# Zoom Security Settings

While Zoom is a widely used online event tool, its default settings are geared more towards conducting a private video chat. For a public seminar, make sure to be aware of issues such as [ZoomBombing](https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/17/zoombombing/) and adjust the settings as recommended below.

## Changing Zoom Settings

To change the settings for future events, log into Zoom’s web interface and go to “[Settings](https://zoom.us/profile/setting)” screen.

### “Schedule Meeting” Section

1.  **Join before host (Off)**
    *   This will prevent any troubles to start before the host can witness.
2.  **Require a password when scheduling new meetings (On) & Embed password in meeting link for one-click join (**Off**)**
    *   If you are setting this up, use the password only trusted or verified participants would know. If the language you use to communicate with meetup members is not English, using an easy answer to a question in your language may be helpful, as the attackers often try to read your messages and scan for a Zoom link & password (they are not always native English speakers but there’s a better chance of them to comprehend English than your language).
    *   Although this setting can increase security, use with caution and try not to alienate any participants with different levels of technical skills. 
3.  **Mute participants upon entry **(On)** & Participants video (Off)**
    *   Only hosts will be able to unmute participants. However, video can be enabled by participants on their own.

### “In Meeting (Basic)” Section

1.  **Sound notification when someone joins or leaves (Off)**
    *   Unless you have a very small group, the sound can get too distracting.
2.  **File transfer (Off)**
3.  **Co-host (On)**
    *   A co-host can help with moderation while the main host is speaking.
    *   If you can, add multiple hosts. At least 3 is recommended.
4.  **Polling (On)**: paid account only
5.  **Disable desktop/screen share for users (Personal Preferences)**
    *   If you know who will need to share their screen, add them as co-hosts beforehand and only allow hosts to share a screen.
    *   If it’s necessary for the participants to share the screen, set the option of “Who can start sharing when someone else is sharing?” to “Host Only” and control the screen sharing.
6.  **Allow removed participants to rejoin (Off)**

### “Other” Section

1.  **Blur snapshot on iOS task switcher (On)**
    *   If you don’t need to explicitly display the preview screen of the task switcher, blur it to hide any potentially sensitive information.
