# Technology Resources for Online WordCamps

In addition to the free tools listed on the [Organizing Virtual Meetups](https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/meetup-organizer/resources/organizing-virtual-events/) page, there are paid tools that may work well when you are organizing a larger event with a budget. Here are some of the tools used in the past online WordCamps and do\_actions.

## Online Event Platforms

### Zoom

Online WordCamps will probably need a paid account if they are using Zoom to facilitate the event. Many organizers use Zoom for sponsor tracks and booths, hallway hangouts, contributor day tracks, watercooler rooms, and for fun and games. The Zoom breakout room feature can also be helpful for online WordCamps.

WordCamp Central has access to [6 Zoom Pro accounts that can be used for online WordCamps](https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/meetup-organizer/getting-started/special-virtual-events-zoom-request/). On request, we can also add a large meeting add-on to our community zoom pro accounts for large WordCamps to facilitate more than 100 attendees.

### Google Meet

Each WordCamp receives a Google Workspace for Nonprofits account under the wordcamp.org domain. With this account, you can run a meeting on Google Meet with extra features such as breakout rooms, hand raise, survey, and Q&A. [More details of the Nonprofits edition can be found here](https://www.google.com/intl/ja/nonprofits/workspace/compare/).

### Hopin

[Hopin](https://hopin.com/) is a virtual event venue with multiple interactive areas for connecting. Attendees can move in and out of rooms to enjoy the content and communication. Used by [WordCamp Prague 2020](https://central.wordcamp.org/news/2021/04/29/making-a-great-online-conference-experience-at-wordcamp-prague/).

### StreamYard

[StreamYard](https://streamyard.com/) is a browser-based live streaming studio that can multi-stream to Facebook, YouTube, LinkedIn, and other platforms. It can be a good choice if you want to have many volunteers to support recording/broadcasting tasks instead of relying on a small number of staff members who have installed specific software for it.

### Airmeet

[Airmeet](https://www.airmeet.com/) is a platform for virtual conferences and workshops with a social lounge for a networking experience. Used by [WordCamp Greece 2021](https://greece.wordcamp.org/2021/%CF%83%CF%87%CE%B5%CF%84%CE%B9%CE%BA%CE%AC/%CF%83%CF%85%CE%BC%CE%BC%CE%B5%CF%84%CE%BF%CF%87%CE%AE-%CF%80%CE%B1%CF%81%CE%B1%CE%BA%CE%BF%CE%BB%CE%BF%CF%8D%CE%B8%CE%B7%CF%83%CE%B7/).

### Crowdcast

[Crowdcast](https://www.crowdcast.io/) is a live-streaming service with features such as multi-streaming, Q&A, green room, and webinars. It has been used for sessoins and game shows during online WordCamps ([WordCamp San Antonio 2010](https://www.crowdcast.io/support1263)), WPBlockTalk, and more.
