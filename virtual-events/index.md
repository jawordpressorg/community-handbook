# Welcome

We are making changes to the Online WordCamp program, and the information provided in this document may not be accurate. While we are working on updating the documentation to reflect the latest changes, please visit the [Make/Community Blog](https://make.wordpress.org/community/) for latest updates on the Online WordCamp program.

Community events are an important part of the WordPress project. Due to COVID-19 concerns, many organizers beginning in February 2020 have had to cancel or postpone their WordCamp or Meetup. Ever since, many WordPress community organizers have hosted online events for their WordPress meetups. In July 2021, the community team [issued new guidelines](https://make.wordpress.org/community/2021/07/01/in-person-meetup-events-for-vaccinated-community-members/) for return to in-person events for communities with contained COVID-19 spread or with easy access to COVID-19 vaccination/testing ([more details here](https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/meetup-organizer/covid-19-guidelines-for-in-person-meetups/)). However, online meetups and online WordCamps are still going strong at this time (August 2021) – with a vast majority of meetup groups opting for online events due to continued COVID-19 challenges.

This site is a handbook for WordPress community organizers who want to host online events so that the community can continue to connect with and inspire each other. Because our expectations for [Meetups](https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/meetup-organizer/) and [WordCamps](https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/wordcamp-organizer/), among other event types, were created with in-person formats in mind, we have proposed and are implementing some new guidelines for virtual events. 

In addition to providing these [new guidelines](https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/virtual-events/welcome/new-guidelines-for-virtual-events-in-2020/), this site also provides instructions on [how to apply for a online WordCamp](https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/virtual-events/welcome/applying-for-a-virtual-event/). As online events are fundamentally different from in-person events, there are also recommendations and suggested best practices for speakers and organizers of virtual events, provided by experienced community members.
