# Tools for Online Meetups and WordCamps

## For Meetups

We are reserving use of the paid online production tools for WordCamps. For meetups (and other smaller events), there are many excellent, free tools to use. [We have a list of suggested tools, along with tips and ideas from community organizers here.](https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/meetup-organizer/resources/organizing-virtual-meetups/)

## For WordCamps

All new online WordCamps, along with existing online WordCamps that did not complete a budget review (as on August 2020), will need to rely on local sponsorship if they wish to work with A/V production vendors. If these camps are not relying on A/V vendors, they can still host the WordCamp using accessible tools (see: [Technology Resources for Online WordCamps](https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/virtual-events/online-wordcamp-guidelines/technology-resources-for-online-wordcamps/)) with the help of local volunteers.

For more information about cost guidelines and the budget review process, [visit this page](https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/virtual-events/online-wordcamp-cost-guidelines-and-the-budget-review-process/).

*Note: WordCamp Central had previously provided Audio Visual vendor support for online WordCamps that were held in the first half of 2020. WordCamp organizers had the option to make use of the recommended vendors or choose to work with a local supplier. You can find more background on this change [in the following blog post](https://make.wordpress.org/community/2020/07/23/moving-forward-with-online-events/).*

## Music and Copyright Considerations

To comply with global copyright laws, when organizing a WordPress event, please only use royalty-free, public domain, or Creative Commons-licensed music in the live event space, in recorded video, and in live streams. [You can find public domain and CCO music on Openverse.](https://openverse.org/search/audio?q=music&license=pdm,cc0)

#### **✅ Music Compliance Checklist**

Before your event, confirm the following:

*   **Will music be played in the event space, live streams, or recordings?**  
    If yes, confirm that it is royalty-free, public domain, or Creative Commons-licensed music.
*   **Are vendors or production teams using music?**  
    If yes, verify that it is royalty-free, public domain, or Creative Commons-licensed music.
*   **Have you reviewed applicable copyright guidelines?**  
    Copyright laws can vary by location. For further guidance, visit the [World Intellectual Property Organization’s (WIPO) music copyright resource](https://href.li/?https://www.wipo.int/en/web/music).

By following these steps, you can prevent disruptions to your live streams, maintain control over event content, and ensure compliance with copyright laws. Please note that this is not legal advice, and i
