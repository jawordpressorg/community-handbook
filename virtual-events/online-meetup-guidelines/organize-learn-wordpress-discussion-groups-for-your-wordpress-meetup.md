# Organize Learn WordPress Online Workshops for your WordPress Meetup

Meetup organizers can use the [Learn WordPress](https://learn.wordpress.org/) content for their meetup events – simply ask your meetup group to watch one of the tutorials in the weeks leading up to your scheduled event, and then host an [online workshop](https://learn.wordpress.org/online-workshops/).

If you are interested, you can start right away by [organizing an online workshop based on one of the available tutorials](https://learn.wordpress.org/tutorials/) for your meetup group. You don’t need to sign up as an online workshop facilitator to organize a workshop for your local meetup. Here’s how you can get started:

1.  Take a look at the available tutorials in [Learn WordPress](https://learn.wordpress.org/) and select one for your meetup group. If you want, you can seek help from other group members in finalizing a tutorial for the online workshop. 
2.  Once you have identified a tutorial for your local meetup group, schedule an online workshop in your Meetup.com group. Specify in the Meetup description that this is an online workshop connected to a tutorial, and ask meetup group members to watch the tutorial video before attending the workshop. Make sure that you plan the event at least a week ahead from the current date, so that your meetup members have enough time to view the tutorial before participating in the online workshop. Alternately, if the tutorial is short (~30 minutes or so), you can consider organizing a watch party for the tutorial too!
3.  Send a message to your Meetup group members announcing the meetup. Encourage them to see the Learn WordPress tutorial video, and request them to participate in the online workshop. This is not a requirement if you are organizing a watch party.
4.  Kick off the event on the planned date and time. If you are organizing the event as a watch party, start the event with a brief intro, and play the tutorial video for your attendees. The watch party can then be followed by an informal discussion.
5.  If you are planning the event in an online workshop format (and not as a watch party), start the event by asking members about how many of them saw the tutorial. You can start by providing a very brief (5-10 minute long) summary of the content. Then, ask questions to members, and try to start a discussion. You can consider innovating – some tips include organizing a quiz towards the end of the session or containing exercises as part of the meetup event.
