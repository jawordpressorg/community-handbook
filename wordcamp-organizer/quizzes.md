# Quizzes

In the end of some of the handbook pages, you will be presented with a quiz to test your knowledge of the material that we’ve covered. Its goal is to help knowledge retention and to make sure you’ve noticed all of the important details. You need to get all of the answers correct in order to pass it, but don’t worry – you can retake the quizzes as often as you like in order to the lofty goal of a 100% pass rate.
