# Video Planning

Nearly every local WordPress community includes some people who have cameras and/or skills to operate them. When you’re planning how to video your WordCamp sessions, the first step is to invite your video-minded community members to contribute to WordCamp. Hiring a firm (and adding to your budget) to capture video should be a last resort.

## Before the event

Start by publicizing your desire for a person to join the organizing team to be in charge of video as soon as you’ve nailed down your venue. Identifying one person to be in charge of getting great video early is a great way to keep ahead of the game.

If you need equipment and your event is in the US, Canada or Western Europe, email WordCamp Central. We can loan you a complete kit with everything you need, including an HD camera, tripod, wireless lapel microphone, and cables/adapters. See the full contents of the Foundation Camera Kits [here](https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/wordcamp-organizer-handbook/video/foundation-camera-kit-list/ "See the full contents of the Foundation Camera Kit").

You can also find documentation on this site for [setting up and operating the necessary equipment](https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/wordcamp-organizer-handbook/video/setting-up-your-video-equipment/), whether provided by the Foundation or sourced locally, so volunteers do not need to be professional videographers (though some background in video is obviously a big help).

## During the event

In addition to the video coordinator, you will also need at least one volunteer per camera to monitor the equipment during filming of the presentations. Operating the cameras is not very demanding and will leave the volunteer free to enjoy the presentations they are filming for the most part, so usually it’s easy to find volunteers to help with this job.

## After everyone goes home

If your WordCamp has a Contributor Day, this is a great opportunity to get invite non-coders (or anyone who loves video) to help with [processing, trimming, naming, and uploading files to WordPress.tv](https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/wordcamp-organizer-handbook/video/after-the-event-post-production/). (Mention the opportunity to help with video in your opening/closing remarks so even more people hear about it!) Video expertise is not needed, just a laptop and willingness to learn.

It is also possible to get help from the WordPress.tv moderator squad with post-production of your WordCamp videos. Email WordCamp Central for more info.

## No logos/sponsors in video

We have more information about the policy of logos in WordCamp videos in [this handy guide](https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/wordcamp-organizer/video/logos-in-wordcamp-videos/).

## Music and Copyright Considerations

To comply with global copyright laws, when organizing a WordPress event, please only use royalty-free, public domain, or Creative Commons-licensed music in the live event space, in recorded video, and in live streams. [You can find public domain and CCO music on Openverse.](https://openverse.org/search/audio?q=music&license=pdm,cc0)

#### **✅ Music Compliance Checklist**

Before your event, confirm the following:

*   **Will music be played in the event space, live streams, or recordings?**  
    If yes, confirm that it is royalty-free, public domain, or Creative Commons-licensed music.
*   **Are vendors or production teams using music?**  
    If yes, verify that it is royalty-free, public domain, or Creative Commons-licensed music.
*   **Have you reviewed applicable copyright guidelines?**  
    Copyright laws can vary by location. For further guidance, visit the [World Intellectual Property Organization’s (WIPO) music copyright resource](https://href.li/?https://www.wipo.int/en/web/music).

By following these steps, you can prevent disruptions to your live streams, maintain control over event content, and ensure compliance with copyright laws. Please note that this is not legal advice, and it remains the responsibility of organizers, vendors, contributors, and others to ensure compliance with applicable laws.
