# Logos in WordCamp Videos

Company logos are permitted in WordCamp videos under the following conditions:

1.  Sponsor logos at the venue (banners, podium, etc.) that are captured on video are fine to leave in the published video.
2.  Speakers are allowed to include their company logo in their slides, **but only in an optional opening/closing informational slide and not throughout the presentation**. This is fine even if their company is not a sponsor of the event.
3.  Similarly, a speaker can wear clothing with their company logo on it, even if their company is not a sponsor.
4.  No company logos of any kind are to be added in post-production. This includes the speaker’s company, event sponsors, the post-production company, or any other company logos.

*For the sake of clarity, “logo” here includes company social media handles and even the company name written out in plain text in lieu of a logo.*

The intention here isn’t to stop companies from gaining exposure (that happens naturally when someone is speaking), but rather to make the content the main focus and intent of the slides rather than any kind of company promotion.

WordCamp speakers are chosen based on their knowledge and experience as individuals and not their company affiliation, and company promotion throughout a slide deck suggests that the opposite is true. An informational slide with the speaker’s company makes sense as information about who is speaking, but the rest of the slide deck should be dedicated to the content being presented.
