# After the Event: Post Production

Your [Foundation video camera](https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/wordcamp-organizer-handbook/video/foundation-camera-kit-list/) is set to record in the AVCHD format, which produces great quality video and audio, but can be difficult to work with. Primarily, AVCHD files will need to be converted to .MP4 format and edited to trim any unnecessary footage from beginning and end of the video.

## Accessing the .MTS files

The first step is to access the .MTS files contained within the AVCHD package, as these are the video files we will need to edit and convert.

This video will show you how to access the AVCHD package and locate the .MTS files found within, as well as how to use the VLC Media Player to preview them.

To download the VLC Media Player shown in this video, visit the [VLC downloads page →](http://www.videolan.org/vlc/#download)

## Trimming and converting to MP4

You can use Avidemux to easily convert your camera’s .MTS files to a more internet friendly format like .MP4, and in the process use the basic editing tools provided to trim the beginning and end of the video.

Follow along with this video to see how it is done.

## Compressing your videos

To upload your video to WordPress.tv, you will need to make sure that your converted video files are under 1GB in size. If the files you created in Avidemux are over this size limit, you can use another open-source app called Handbrake to compress them so that they can be uploaded. Follow along with this video to see how you can compress your video files

If you have several files to compress, you can make the job a little easier by batch compressing your files instead, as shown in this video

## Gathering the related information

Before uploading your videos to WordPress.tv, you will want to make sure you have the following information handy, as you will need to enter them into the form that accompanies the uploader at WordPress.tv. For each video, you will need:

*   Speaker Name
*   Title of the Presentation
*   Description of the presentation (from the WordCamp site)
*   URL to online copy of presentation slides

You will also want to take the time to change the filename on all of your videos to include the WordCamp name, year and title of the presentation. Eventually also the speaker name and the date. Use this filename as an example:

WCSF-2013-writing-code-as-user-experience-design.mp4

This will help the volunteer moderators at WordPress.tv to find and publish your videos quickly, and with all the important information.

## Uploading your video to WordPress.tv

Once you have your videos properly converted, compressed, titled, and the above metadata, please go to [http://wordpress.tv/submit-video/](http://wordpress.tv/submit-video/) and upload your WordCamp video.

Fill out all the required fields, and for “Description” be sure to add the URL to slides along with the description of the talk. No HTML please (it will be stripped out) so just the plaintext description and URL.  The volunteer moderators at WordPress.tv will make sure everything is formatted correctly when the video is published.

Next select your video file using the file chooser, and start your upload. Be sure not to power down your computer or disconnect from the internet until the upload is complete.
