# Camera Kit Request

**Please note that camera requests made *less than 4 weeks before your WordCamp* may not be fulfilled, due to time constraints**.

If you’re in the US, Europe, or Canada, fill out the form below and we will ship you [camera kits](https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/wordcamp-organizer/video/foundation-camera-kit-list/) with everything you need.  We’ll confirm your request within a few days.

If your camp is outside of the US, Europe, or Canada, try talking to your local university’s film school to see if they are able to help with your camera needs.
