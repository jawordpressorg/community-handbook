# Sharing Social Media Accounts

This guide initially covers Twitter/X, but the next step would be to add other social media accounts as well in the future.

As part of an effort to manage access for all social media accounts, we created this guide so you can proactively share the access with the team.

This step is essential to ensure that account access isn’t limited to just a few individuals, allowing Program Managers to recover access if the next organizing team needs it or if the original team loses access.

## Twitter/X

1\. Add 2FA to your account

Adding 2FA to the account should be a straightforward process, and you can do it by going to your Security settings, then selecting the two-factor authentication option, and selecting “Authentication app” from there.

This link should get you directly to setup page: [https://twitter.com/i/flow/two-factor-auth-app-enrollment](https://twitter.com/i/flow/two-factor-auth-app-enrollment)

This page will show you the QR code and require you to set this up with an authentication app. You can use something like [Authy](https://authy.com/) or [Google Authenticator](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1066447?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid) to read the QR code and save it as the code that you need to use when accessing Twitter.

**Please take a screenshot of your QR Code there so we can set the same solution from our end.** This loses a bit of the benefit of 2FA, but it should still be efficient if you delete the

2\. Share the password and 2FA with the Community team

Now that your 2FA is ready, it is time to share the credentials with the team.

Please go to [QuickForget.com](https://quickforget.com/), and create a shareable link with the following details:

*   Username
*   Password
*   QR code (you can attach the image)
*   Backup codes

After that, please share the link with the Community team — add one week for the expiration of the link.

3\. Giving access to other co-organizers

After the initial setup, the most effective way to share access is by using [the Delegate feature](https://twitter.com/settings/delegate/members). You can add users as admin and they can manage it directly from their own accounts.
