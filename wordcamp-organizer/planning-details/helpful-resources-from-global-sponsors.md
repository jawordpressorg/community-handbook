### **Kinsta**

[Kinsta](https://kinsta.com/) is the top-ranked WordPress hosting company on the [user-review site G2](https://kinsta.com/blog/g2-awards/) because more  
than 120,000 businesses know we’re fanatical about keeping their websites up and running.  

Web publishers want to focus on their content. Developers, their code. Agencies, their clients.  
Nobody wants to waste time restarting servers, fending off hackers, configuring caches,  
launching backups, or repeatedly updating WordPress plugins and themes.  

Instead, we’re serious about the “managed” part of [Managed Hosting for WordPress](https://kinsta.com/wordpress-hosting/). That  
means fine-tuning the fastest virtual machines available in 37+ Google Cloud data centers. It  
means harnessing Cloudflare’s network to protect customer websites from DDoS attacks and  
help them distribute their content globally.  

It also means empowering customers with Kinsta’s custom dashboard, MyKinsta, loaded with  
tools that make it simple to deploy, update, and monitor WordPress sites — whether that’s one  
site or a hundred.  

Moving to Kinsta is easy, because we offer unlimited free migrations. Once you’re on board,  
customer support is available 24/7 in 10 languages.  

And we play well with your team: Just ask the affiliate marketers earning recurring monthly  
revenue from Kinsta and the [Agency Partner Program](https://kinsta.com/wordpress-hosting/agencies/) members who are delighting their own  
customers on our platform.
