# Incident Reporting

To report a code of conduct-related issue, email [report@wordcamp.org](mailto:report@wordcamp.org). Emails sent to this address will go to a private mailbox on the global community team’s Help Scout instance, visible only to deputies on an incident response squad.

A stand-alone [Incident Reporting form](https://central.wordcamp.org/incident-report/) is also available, to make it easier for attendees and community members to report issues that come up with their local community organizers, to someone other than their local community organizers.

If the incident response squad receives a report that looks like it could be handled locally — for example, between attendees at a WordCamp — a member of the global community team will get in touch with local community organizers to offer assistance.

If the report is \*about\* a community organizer, then we’ll reach out to the concerned parties and work to resolve the situation.

If the report is about behavior that didn’t happen at an “official” event (which is to say, a chapter meetup event, WordCamp, or other workshop organized as part of a global community team program), we’ll request permission to pass the report along to the team it involves (or to the [Escalation Team](https://make.wordpress.org/community/2015/07/02/escalation-team/#comment-22773), currently made up of Josepha Haden Chomphosy, Helen Hou-Sandi, Tammie Lister, Aditya Kane, Morten Rand-Hendriksen, and Jenny Wong).

Currently the people who have access to this private mailbox are: Andrea Middleton, Josepha Haden Chomphosy, Cami Kaos, Hugh Lashbrooke, Aditya Kane, Courtney Patubo-Kranzke, and Rocío Valdivia.

The incident response squad tries to respond to all reports within 72 hours of receiving the report. Resolving the issue reported may take as long as 2-3 months, depending on the nature of the issue.
