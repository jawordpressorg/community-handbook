# Incident Reporting

To report a code of conduct\-related issue, email [reports@wordpress.org](mailto:reports@wordpress.org). Emails sent to this address will go to a private mailbox, visible only to members of the WordPress Incident Response Team.

A stand-alone [Incident Reporting form](https://central.wordcamp.org/incident-report/) is also available, so that attendees and community members can feel comfortable reporting issues that come up with their local community organizers.

If the Incident Response Team receives a report that looks like it could be handled locally — for example, between attendees at a WordCamp — a member of the incident response team will get in touch with local community organizers to offer assistance.

If the report is *about* a community organizer, then we’ll reach out to the concerned parties and work to resolve the situation.

If the report is about behavior that didn’t happen at an “official” WordPress event (which is to say, a chapter meetup event, WordCamp, or other event organized as part of the off WordPress community events program), we’ll request permission to pass the report along to the team it involves or to the WordPress Executive Director, Mary Hubbard.

The incident response team tries to respond to all reports within 72 hours of receiving the report. Resolving the issue reported may take as long as 2-3 months, depending on the nature of the issue.

[The Incident Response Team Handbook](https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/irt/) contains additional information about the Incident Response Team, including its members and processes.
