# Incident Response Plan for Organizers

The following Incident Response Plan Template can be used by WordPress event organizing teams to prepare for responding to on-site incident reports.

All WordPress community participants – including WordCamp and meetup organizers, volunteers, speakers, and sponsors – are expected to to follow the [WordPress Community Code of Conduct](https://make.wordpress.org/handbook/community-code-of-conduct/).

**Check out the online WordPress Incident Response Team training:** [https://learn.wordpress.org/course/incident-response-team-training/](https://learn.wordpress.org/course/incident-response-team-training/)

As anyone can submit an incident report when they see something happen, this training is for any WordPress community member who would like to be prepared to help their fellow community members in submitting an incident report. This training, especially the workshop on taking incident reports, will be particularly helpful for WordCamp organizers who want to know what to do in case of a Code of Conduct violation.

We strongly recommend that all members of your WordCamp’s First Response Group and Backup Response Group (described below) complete the [online Incident Response Team training](https://learn.wordpress.org/course/incident-response-team-tra).

## Process for responding to a medical emergency or violence

**If there is an incident where there is a clear and present danger, take the following steps:** 

1.  Ensure your personal safety.
2.  Call the venue’s emergency line or the local emergency services (ambulance, police) for help.
3.  Ensure all parties are safe and have access to medical services if needed.
4.  If possible, collect the name(s) and contact info for anyone receiving emergency medical services at the event.
5.  Follow up by sharing with the WordPress Global Community Team’s incident response squad by emailing [reports@wordpress.org](mailto:reports@wordpress.org) or filling out [the incident report](https://central.wordcamp.org/incident-report/).

## Process for responding to incident reports

If you need to take a report about an incident that may violate the [code of conduct](https://make.wordpress.org/handbook/community-code-of-conduct/), remember to maintain confidentiality at all times.

1.  Inform people on the organizing team that someone has reported a problem, while protecting the reporter’s confidentiality. 
2.  To take a report, find a quiet place and if possible, ask another organizer to join you. If you have any potential conflict of interest in taking the report (such as if any person involved in the report works at the same company as you), ask another member of the safety team to do so for you. 
3.  Ask if the person would like to make a formal code of conduct report. Do not make any promises as to how reports will be handled, but let them know that the safety team will make every effort to protect the reporter’s confidentiality and safety.
4.  If they do not want to make a formal report, you can ask if they would like to make the report anonymous. If they still do not want to make a formal report, the best you can do is to help them feel safe and heard while at the event.
5.  If they are making the report, ask them to describe the incident. Items that would be helpful include:
    *   Identifying information for any alleged harasser(s)/witnesses/people involved
    *   Reporter’s name and contact information so that we can follow up
    *   Time and date of incident + time and date of the report
    *   Place of incident
    *   Summary of incident
    *   Names of other people involved
6.  Depending on the severity of the report, you may need to notify emergency services. Make sure to note this in the report.
7.  After you have gathered information, thank the reporter.
    *   If appropriate, you can ask if there is anything else you can do to help make them feel safe (for example, finding a friend of theirs to stay with them, or giving them a private space to sit in). 
    *   Let them know that you will be sharing the report with the incident response team, and that we will follow up after reviewing. 
    *   If they are making the report anonymously, you can reassure them that we will do everything we can to make sure their name is anonymous. 
8.  Follow up by sharing with the WordPress Global Community Team’s Incident Response Team by emailing [reports@wordpress.org](reports@wordpress.org) or filling out [the incident report](https://central.wordcamp.org/incident-report/), especially if confidentiality is required.
