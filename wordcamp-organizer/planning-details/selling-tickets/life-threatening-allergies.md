# Severe allergies

If an attendee shares that they have a severe allergy as part of the registration process, the WordCamp organizing team should reach out to the attendee right away to find out what kind of arrangements will be necessary to make a safe environment for the attendee.

If the allergy is food-related, organizers should inform the caterer or food vendor(s) of the allergy, and request a list of ingredients for all the food that will be served at the event. Depending on the severity of the allergy, it may be necessary to purchase special food for the affected attendee, and even to ensure that none of the food served at the event includes a certain ingredient.

The venue contact should also be informed that someone with a severe allergy will be on site. The WordCamp organizing team should make sure the volunteer staff knows how to call emergency services in case of emergency. The attendee’s name should not be shared with volunteers or vendors without the attendee’s permission.

If you have questions about how to ensure that an attendee with severe allergies is safe at your event, email support@wordcamp.org and a community team deputy will help.
