# The Process of Transitioning Out a WordCamp Organizing Team Member

WordCamp organizing teams often find themselves in situations where a member of the organizing committee can no longer be part of the committee. Some of the main reasons for this are:

*   Personal Reasons:
    *   Work or family life no longer allows time to serve on the WordCamp organizing committee
    *   Illness or other medical issue
*   Performance Reasons:
    *   Unable to keep in touch
    *   Communication problems within the team
    *   Minimum workload is not being met
*   Violation of Code of Conduct or Organizer Agreement

## What to do as a Lead Organizer

### If you receive a request to withdraw for Personal Reasons

If you receive a notification that someone wishes to leave for personal reasons, please respect the member’s decision and promptly enter the withdrawal process shown below.

### Things to try before dismissing a member for Performance Reasons

Remember, communication is key. If the reason a team member wishes to step down is communication issues, we recommend having an open conversation with them first as discord can arise from small misunderstandings. Also, there may be a path for improvement in the whole team through discussions. You may be able to continue by making adjustments to a person’s responsibilities. Don’t be afraid to change teams or responsibilities midway through.

It is important to make multiple attempts to contact the team member if they are not responsive as there are possible life events that may affect their ability to communicate with other organizers. 

If there is a member of the Organizing Team who wants to withdraw, you can also consult with your assigned Event Supporter for a solution. If this person is not available, please reach out in the [#community-team](https://make.wordpress.org/community/tag/community-team/) slack channel or send an email to [support@wordcamp.org](mailto:support@wordcamp.org) for further assistance.

If the solutions above do not improve the situation, or the team member still wishes to leave, proceed to the transition process below.

### Violation of the Code of Conduct or Organizer Agreement

If you have any serious problems please send an [incident report](https://central.wordcamp.org/incident-report/). If there are any other violations of the Code of Conduct or the Organizer Agreement, first try to discuss whether improvements can be made.

If it is decisive to leave after trying to improve, proceed to the process of leaving.

## Withdrawal Process

*   Qualified people must send a message with their decision to leave to a lead organizer(s). If a knowledge transfer is required, do it as early as possible
*   As soon as the necessary work is completed, delete the user’s login accounts to planning tools etc. within 3 to 7 days
    *   Google account, Slack, GitHub, WordPress.org website, P2, management tools (Backlog, Trello, etc.), other tools (SNS, graphic tools, etc.)
    *   Change tool access password if necessary

The decision to leave the organizer listing on the WordCamp website  should be decided based on the reason for leaving and the status of contributions up to that point.

If the Lead Organizer is stepping down, please include the information of the new person in that role in an email to [support@wordcamp.org](mailto:support@wordcamp.org) and let the community know of this change in leadership. You may need to update your WordCamp tracker contact information, etc.

## For Members Considering Leaving the WordCamp Organizing Team

If an issue arises where an organizing team member considers resigning, make sure to communicate this openly and as soon as possible to ensure a smooth transition in leadership. 

Even if you leave the organizing team for the event, you still have the chance to participate as an attendee as long as Code of Conduct violations didn’t occur.
