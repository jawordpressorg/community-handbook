# Slide Decks

When preparing slides for a WordCamp talk, speakers have free reign to design them however they wish within the following guides:

## Follow the Code of Conduct

The [WordPress Community Code of Conduct](https://make.wordpress.org/handbook/community-code-of-conduct/) and [WordCamp Code of Conduct](https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/wordcamp-organizer/planning-details/code-of-conduct/) outlines how to behave at a WordCamp, and we expect speakers to follow this guide in their slide decks as well. This means that slides should be respectful, not include demeaning, discriminatory or harassing content, and be family friendly (i.e. no foul language, nudity or other inappropriate content).

## Do not over-use company logos

Speakers are allowed to include their company logo in their slides, but **only in an optional opening/closing informational slide and not throughout the presentation**. This is fine even if their company is not a sponsor of the event. Similarly, a speaker can wear clothing with their company logo on it, even if their company is not a sponsor.

*For the sake of clarity, “logo” here includes company social media handles and even the company name written out in plain text in lieu of a logo.*

WordCamp speakers are chosen based on their knowledge and experience as individuals and not their company affiliation, and company promotion throughout a slide deck suggests that the opposite is true. An informational slide with the speaker’s company makes sense as information about who is speaking, but the rest of the slide deck should be dedicated to the content being presented.

## Respect the GPL

All talks (and slide decks) must respect the GPL. In practice, this means any WordPress plugins or themes that are mentioned *must* be licenced under the GPL or a compatible licence. For more information, read our [GPL Primer](https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/wordcamp-organizer/planning-details/gpl-primer/) and go through the [100% GPL Vetting Checklist](https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/wordcamp-organizer/first-steps/helpful-documents-and-templates/100-gpl-vetting-checklist/).

## Understand Copyrights and Fair Use

When including images, text, videos, and any other materials that the speaker themselves didn’t produce, make sure that they are using them in accordance with copyright laws and/or the Terms of Use of the provider. Note that the Fair Use laws are interpreted differently in different countries.
