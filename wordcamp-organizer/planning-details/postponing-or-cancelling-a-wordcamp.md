# Postponing or Cancelling a WordCamp

> This page is a work in progress. If you have any additional tips, please [contact the Global Community Team](https://make.wordpress.org/community/contact/), or [comment on the “Event Cancellation Guidelines and Procedures” post](https://make.wordpress.org/community/2020/02/28/event-cancellation-guidelines-and-procedures/).

### Assess whether to postpone or cancel your WordCamp

*   What are the circumstances that have lead to thinking about postponing or cancellation and can those change drastically (to better) in a short period of time? *If not => cancel*
*   Will the majority of the organizing team still want to be involved if WordCamp is postponed? *If not => cancel*
*   Does the WordCamp gather attendees and sponsors from wide region (for example from multiple countries) rather than from local areas? *If does => cancel*
*   Would the WordCamp be postponed past the current calendar year? *If yes => cancel*
*   Is the same venue or some other sensible alternative available for the date(s) postponing is planned? *If not => cancel*

Once you have determined if you will postpone or cancel your WordCamp, please email support@wordcamp.org to let the Community Team know about your decision. Please also follow the guidelines below. Items marked with an asterisk (\*) will be completed by a Deputy/Mentor. Items marked with a double asterisk (\*\*) need to be performed by a Super Deputy with Proxy Access. Ping in slack [#community-team](https://make.wordpress.org/community/tag/community-team/) if you need help

#### If postponing:

*WordCamp postponement is defined by a change to a date in the same calendar year. If you’re postponing to the next calendar year, please see the Cancellation section below.*

*   **Remove tickets** from public-facing page so tickets can no longer be purchased (This is done by setting the ticket availability to an end date in the past – [see screenshot](https://make.wordpress.org/community/files/2020/03/Close-ticket-sales.jpg)).\*
*   **Send postponement email** to attendees via *Tools -> Notify*.
*   **Refund all purchased tickets** after email goes out\*\*. *Why refund in the case of postponement?* Our concern is holding on to funds if the situation gets any worse, so we would prefer to refund now so that we aren’t holding on to people’s money. So unless you can confirm a rescheduled date very quickly, we strongly recommend refunding all tickets.
*   **Contact venue** to confirm postponement and find new date
*   **Contact Speakers**
*   **Contact sponsors** about the postponement. If the new date is in the same calendar year, offer them the choice between a refund or carrying their sponsorship over to the rescheduled event. If the new date is in the next calendar year, sponsors should be refunded.
*   **Refund paid sponsors** that request refunds.\*
*   **Void sent (but unpaid) sponsor invoices\***
*   **Email vendors** and ask if their any payment/deposits made can be applied to the postponed date, and request refunds if necessary.
*   **Change event status** (back to “Pre-planning” if postponing to next year. Mark as “Cancelled” if pushing to the next calendar year).\*
*   **Draft announcement on WordCamp Central** (then notify a deputy to publish, which auto-posts to Twitter and Facebook)

**\*Items marked with an asterisk will be completed by a Deputy/Mentor.**

#### If cancelling:

*Cancellation is for moving to a new date in the next calendar year, or cancelling for the foreseeable future*.

*   **Remove tickets** from public-facing page so tickets can no longer be purchased (This is done by setting the ticket availability to an end date in the past– [see screenshot](https://make.wordpress.org/community/files/2020/03/Close-ticket-sales.jpg))\*
*   **Send cancellation email** to attendees via *Tools -> Notify*.
*   **Refund all purchased tickets** after email goes out\*
*   **Email venue** to start cancellation process
*   **Email paid vendors** to cancel and request refunds if necessary
*   **Contact all invoiced sponsors**
*   **Refund all paid sponsors\***
*   **Void sent (but unpaid) sponsor invoices\***
*   **Contact global sponsors\***
*   **Contact Speakers**
*   **Change event status to “Cancelled”\***
*   **Draft announcement on WordCamp Central** (then notify a deputy to publish, which auto-posts to Twitter and Facebook)

#### Opting for a livestream event

For WordCamp organizers who are considering cancelling or postponing their eventp, deputies are currently researching how to provide infrastructure and support for livestream alternatives. Please see the post [“Researching livestream infrastructure and support”](https://make.wordpress.org/community/2020/03/04/researching-livestream-infrastructure-and-support/) for more information.

You can also refer to the handbook page for Meetup organizers titled [“Organizing Virtual Events”](https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/meetup-organizer/resources/organizing-virtual-events/) for some more livestream ideas and tips.
