# Global Community Sponsorship Program — For Sponsors

This page has information for companies interested in sponsoring WordPress community events through the Global Community Sponsorship program. If you are an event organizer looking for more information about global sponsors or the global community program in general, please check out [Global Community Sponsorship — For Event Organizers](https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/wordcamp-organizer-handbook/planning-details/fundraising/global-community-sponsorship-for-event-organizers/) in the WordCamp Organizing Handbook.

### Sponsoring Community Events

Thanks for your interest in supporting the WordPress community via event sponsorship! We’re so grateful to our sponsors, because without them we couldn’t put on the events that help our community connect and grow.

When you sponsor an official WordPress event, you’re not just giving money in exchange for presence at the event. Sponsorships are donations, given to support the WordPress open source project. Attendee information (i.e., email addresses) is never provided to sponsors as part of a sponsorship package. Sponsorships are donations, given to support the WordPress open source project.

There are two ways to sponsor: through the Global Community program, or through direct sponsorship of individual events.
