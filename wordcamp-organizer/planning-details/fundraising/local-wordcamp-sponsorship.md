# ローカル WordCamp スポンサーシップ

<!--
<p>WordCamps are a great opportunity for companies that benefit from a free and open source software like WordPress to give back to the project that’s given them so much. Many companies are built around WordPress. A company that sponsors might have a lot of customers who love WordPress; other companies might just use WordPress, love it, and want to give back.</p>

<p>WordCamp は WordPress のようなオープンソースソフトウェアからの恩恵を受けている企業にとって、そのたくさんの恩恵をもたらした WordPress プロジェクトに恩返しができる絶好の機会です。多くの企業が WordPress の周りで立ち上げられています。WordCamp のスポンサーをしているある会社は WordPress を愛する数多くの顧客を持っているかもしれません。また他のある会社は WordPress を使っているだけかもしれませんし、 WordPress を愛しているかもしれませんし、恩返しをしたいかもしれません。</p>

<h2>WordCamp sponsorship packages</h2>
<p>Setting up your local sponsorship packages can be a challenge. Not everyone is accustomed to fundraising, and some organizers develop a nasty case of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome">impostor syndrome</a> when they start looking at how to acknowledge companies that give their event a chunk of cash to help make WordCamp happen. The WordCamp program has an established set of sponsorship rules, which apply to your event. So how do you set up WordCamp sponsorship packages that show gratitude to your sponsors but don’t give away the store?</p>
<p>We’ve assembled some common WordCamp sponsor acknowledgement methods that are appropriate, respectful of attendees, and easy for your volunteer organizing team to follow through on.  Mix and match to create your own packages*!</p>
<ul>
<li>Logo on the site</li>
<li>Company description on the site</li>
<li>Thanks in a blog post thanking all sponsors just before the event</li>
<li>Tickets (reserved and/or complimentary) for company representatives of the sponsor</li>
<li>A certain number of items on the self-serve swag table</li>
<li>Logo on slide projected between presentations</li>
<li>Tweet(s) and/or posts to Facebook (etc) thanking the sponsor</li>
<li>Logo on name badge (good for the top package)</li>
<li>Thanks in pre- and/or post-event emails (good for the top package)</li>
<li>Thank you in opening or closing remarks (good for the top package)</li>
<li>A table at the event in a high traffic area (good for the top package)</li>
</ul>
<p>*You don’t have to use all of them! Really!</p>
<p>In general, sponsors are not looking for a laundry list of perks, they want to support WordCamp and WordPress.  Offering space for your top sponsors to connect with the attendees is generally the most desirable benefit, but not a requirement. Certainly attendees should never be inconvenienced by sponsor acknowledgement, and WordCamps never provide a speaker slot or attendee information to sponsors.</p>

<p> </p>
<ul>

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3. Sponsors agree that the WordPress Foundation, any subsidiary or related entity of the Foundation, and WordCamp organizers have the right to request and review sponsor materials in advance of an event, to require changes to any materials in advance, and to require that any materials that do not meet the above expectations be taken down or that any practices that do not meet the above expectations be discontinued during a WordCamp or event. The above restrictions also apply to material placed on any self-serve swag tables reserved for sponsor use.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4. All sponsors are expected to support the WordPress project and its principles, including:
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>No discrimination on the basis of economic or social status, race, color, ethnic origin, national origin, creed, religion, political belief, sex, sexual orientation, marital status, age, or disability.</li>

<li>No spammers</li>
<li>No jerks</li>
<li>Respect the WordPress trademark.</li>
<li>Embrace the WordPress license; If distributing WordPress-derivative works (themes, plugins, WP distros), any person or business officially associated with WordCamp should give their users the same freedoms that WordPress itself provides: 100% GPL or compatible, the same guidelines we follow on WordPress.org. ***Note: this is one step above simple compliance, which requires PHP code to be GPL / compatible but allows proprietary licenses for JavaScript, CSS, and images. 100% GPL or compatible is required for promotion at WordCamps when WordPress-derivative works are involved, the same guidelines we follow on WordPress.org.***</li>

The WordPress Foundation and any subsidiary or related entity of the Foundation reserve the right to modify the above requirements and expectations at any time by providing written notice to the sponsor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>6. Due to the variety of regulations surrounding the act of selling physical goods and the potential for liability to fall on the WPCS, selling physical goods at a WordCamp is not allowed.</td>
