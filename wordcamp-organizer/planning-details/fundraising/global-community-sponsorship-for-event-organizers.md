# Global Community Sponsorship — For Event Organizers

*If you have questions about any of this, ask in the [#community-events](https://make.wordpress.org/community/tag/community-events/) channel in* [*WordPress.slack.com*](https://wordpress.slack.com/) *or* [*contact the Community Team*](https://make.wordpress.org/community/contact/)*.*

**All 2025 WordCamps and event websites should display the 2025 Global Sponsors. For sponsors with multiple brands, please reach out to their points of contact to confirm which brand will attend your event.**

## What is the Global Community Sponsorship program?

Some companies want to support every official WordPress event in the world or in a certain region. To help facilitate this, WordCamp Central administrates the Global Community Sponsorship Program: we bill the sponsors a certain amount every quarter and then distribute the funds based on the financial needs of each WordPress Meetup group, WordCamp, or other official WordPress community event.

*Please note that the Global Community Sponsorship program does not include current or future flagship events such as WordCamp Europe, WordCamp Asia, the Community Summit, or WordCamp US, even though they’re listed on the official schedule.*

## Who are the Global Community Sponsors for 2025?

**The following Global Community sponsors have signed sponsorship contracts for 2025**:

*   [Automattic](https://automattic.com/) (Jetpack and WordPress.com)
*   [A2 Hosting](https://www.a2hosting.com/)
*   [Bluehost](https://www.bluehost.com/) (or Yoast)
*   [Woo](https://woocommerce.com/)
*   [Kinsta](https://kinsta.com/)

*   WordCamps are expected to honor [the WordPress.org privacy policy](https://wordpress.org/about/privacy/).

It is never allowed to provide attendee information to sponsors as a part of a sponsorship package.

## **WordPress Community Event Sponsor Guidelines**

1\. Sponsor may provide:

*   The sponsor’s name and logo
*   Slogans that are an established part of the sponsor’s image
*   The sponsor’s brands and trade names
    *   On the WordCamp site only one brand will be listed
    *   It is allowed to mention multiple brands in the sponsor’s bio if they are affiliated, but it will be included **only one** brand link
    *   During the WordCamp, at the sponsor’s booth, the sponsor can mention and provide multiple sponsor materials
*   Sponsor contact information (such as telephone numbers, email addresses, and URLs)
*   Factual (value-neutral) displays of actual products
*   Displays or handout materials (such as brochures) with factual, non-comparative descriptions or listings of products or services
*   Price information, or other indications of savings or value, if factual and provable
*   Inducements to purchase or use the Sponsor’s products or services, for example by providing coupons or discount purchase codes (subject to approval)
*   Calls to action, such as “visit this site for details”, “call now for a special offer”, “join our league of savings”, etc.

2\. Sponsors may not provide:

*   Promotional or marketing material containing comparative messages about the Sponsor, its products or services, such as “the first name in WordPress hosting”, “the easiest way to launch your site”, or “the best e-commerce plugin”
*   Claims that WordPress, the WordPress Foundation, WordPress Community Support, meetup organizers, WordCamps, or WordCamp organizers endorse or favor a Sponsor or its products or services (such as “certified WordPress training” or “WordCamp’s favorite plugin”)

3\. As a sponsor, please keep in mind that WordCamp is different from other tech/trade shows that you may have attended or sponsored. The focus of WordCamp is on the WordPress open source project and associated community, and as a result, you will notice much less obtrusive sponsor advertising at the event venue, and in the host city. This is intentional, to keep the focus of WordCamp where it belongs: on WordPress.  

With this in mind, you agree to limit all of your advertising and promotional materials and activities to your official sponsor booth or table, and to the official branding that’s part of your sponsorship package. Other than that, advertising and promotions aren’t permitted at the WordCamp venue, the official WordCamp hotel, after party locale, and at any other spaces associated with the WordCamp. Additionally, Sponsors should not organize events that conflict or compete with official WordCamp activities, workshops, associated events, and parties. Please keep in mind that a breach of these requirements is a serious matter, and could result in a breach of this Sponsorship Agreement and termination of your Sponsorship. So if you’re unsure about whether a promotional activity you’re considering is allowed, please ask the event organizers before going ahead with it.  

With regard to sponsor materials, Sponsors also agree that WordPress Community Support, any subsidiary or related entity of the WordPress Community Support, and WordCamp organizers have the right to request and review sponsor materials in advance of an event, to require changes to any materials in advance, and to require that any materials that do not meet WordCamp standards (as determined by WPCS, or the organizers) be taken down or that any practices that do not meet WordCamp standards be discontinued during a WordCamp or event. This also applies to materials placed on any self-serve swag tables reserved for sponsor use.  

4\. All sponsors are expected to support the WordPress project and its principles, including:

*   No discrimination on the basis of economic or social status, race, color, ethnic origin, national origin, creed, religion, political belief, sex, sexual orientation, marital status, age, or disability.
*   No incitement to violence or promotion of hate
*   No spammers
*   No jerks
*   Respect the WordPress trademark.
*   Embrace the WordPress license; If distributing WordPress-derivative works (themes, plugins, WP distros), any person or business officially associated with WordCamp should give their users the same freedoms that WordPress itself provides: 100% GPL or compatible, the same guidelines we follow on WordPress.org.
*   Don’t promote companies or people that violate the trademark or distribute WordPress derivative works which aren’t 100% GPL compatible.

5\. Sponsorship is in no way connected to the opportunity to speak at an official WordPress event and does not alter the WordPress or WordCamp trademark usage policy found at [http://wordpressfoundation.org/](http://wordpressfoundation.org/). The WordPress Foundation and any subsidiary or related entity of the Foundation reserve the right to modify the above requirements and expectations at any time by providing written notice to the sponsor.
