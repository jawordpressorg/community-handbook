# Volunteers

Have a sign up area on your blog for volunteers, preferably with volunteer job descriptions ([example](http://2011.sf.wordcamp.org/2011/08/02/call-for-volunteers/)). If you are able, offer them free admission or half price as an incentive (but don’t advertise that on the site!). Try to get at least 20 volunteers. It is recommended that you call all of them individually or have a conference call to orient them and thank them for volunteering. Sometimes this can make them feel more committed and responsible so they’re less likely to bail on you later. Tell them you’ll contact them again to give them their volunteer assignments. When you get all your volunteers, make a spreadsheet of their names, times, duties and cell phone numbers.

Example

Clara Oswin Oswald:  registration 8-10 a.m. 123-456-7891

Ideally, people should not have more than 2-3 hour shifts, so they can enjoy the camp too.

Some volunteer duties would be:

> **Registration**
> 
> · Come an hour before registration starts to help set-up.
> 
> · Make sure you clarify whether or not you’ll be accepting walk-ins (cash and checks only). Tell walk-ins not to take a t-shirt because there’s only enough for those that pre-registered.
> 
> · There should be 4 lines split up alphabetically by last name. Make sure there are clear, prominent signs with the letters.
> 
> · Registration volunteers should have a mobile device or laptop, plus a charger, so they can use [the attendance page](https://plan.wordcamp.org/2014/10/28/wordcamp-organizer-roles/) to check-in attendees. After marking each person as having checked-in, direct them to pick up their name tag which are on a separate table and in alpha order by first name.
> 
> · If someone is not on the attendance page, write their name down and have them make their own name tag at the name tag area.
> 
> · Make sure the registration desk is neat and clean.
> 
> If someone insists they’ve registered but their name isn’t on the list, take down their e-mail, make them a name tag and sort it out later.
> 
> **Nametag table**
> 
> · This volunteer should help attendees find their name tag.
> 
> · Make sure the area is neat and clean.
> 
> · Help people make their nametag if it wasn’t initially pre-printed.
> 
> · Direct attendees to t-shirt/swag area.
> 
> **Swag (“Stuff We All Get”!)**
> 
> · Make sure swag is fully stocked.
> 
> · Make sure everything is neatly displayed.
> 
> · Sponsors swag, WordCamp swag and other swag should all be displayed on separate tables.
> 
> **T-shirt handout**
> 
> · There should be 4 lines alphabetically by first name.
> 
> · Volunteers will have a list of attendees and their t-shirt size.
> 
> · Hand the attendee their t-shirt and mark their name off the list.
> 
> · Sizes cannot be traded. They can only get the size they registered with.
> 
> · Walk-ins don’t get a t-shirt. If there are extras at the end after everyone has gotten them, it’s first come first serve.
> 
> · Make sure area is neat and clean.
> 
> **Food and beverages**

> 
> · Text speaker 20 minutes before their speaking time telling them to report to stage and get fitted with mic, etc.

E-mail volunteers their duties and all the organizer’s cell phone numbers.

Second volunteers call!

Have another conference call with your volunteers a week before the event. By now they should have received e-mails with their duties. Go over the schedule for the day, what time everyone should be there and that they’ll have to stay longer to clean-up. Make sure everyone has the organizers cell-phone numbers programmed into their cell phone. Open up for questions. If you want them to wear a specific item to identify them as a volunteer, that should be mentioned here.

Have the volunteer schedule posted at every station with volunteer schedule, program schedule, volunteer / organizer’s cell #’s and emergency procedures.
