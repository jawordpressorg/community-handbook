# Banners and Flyers

Help your attendees understand the many different ways to get involved with WordPress. Teams are explained on [https://make.wordpress.org](https://make.wordpress.org) but for visualizing them with banners at your WordCamp or having flyers on the tables, start with the resources below:

*   Full page flyer – [PDF](https://make.wordpress.org/community/files/2022/08/get-involved-flyer-2022.pdf)
*   Contributor badge sticker sheet – [PDF](https://make.wordpress.org/community/files/2022/08/contributor-stickers-2022.pdf)
*   The [icons](https://github.com/WordPress/dashicons/tree/master/sources/svg) are available in svg format
*   *OLD archive of 2019 materials –* [*ZIP*](https://make.wordpress.org/community/files/2019/03/get-involved-source-files-2019.zip)

If you want to add translations for your language, follow these steps:

*   Check if the Get-Involved text has been already translated into your language on [https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/meta/get-involved](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/meta/get-involved)
*   If not, propose translations and/or get in contact with your translation team on [https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/teams/](https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/teams/)
*   Let us know on slack in the [community-team](https://wordpress.slack.com/messages/community-team) channel if you have created any in your language so we can centralize them!

All teams follow the color coding as defined by the meta team on [https://make.wordpress.org/meta/handbook/documentation/profile-badges/](https://make.wordpress.org/meta/handbook/documentation/profile-badges/)
