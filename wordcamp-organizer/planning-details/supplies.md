# Supplies

> tl;dr: WordCamp Central will ship you official lanyards; be sure you have extra office supplies at the registration desk.

The kind of supplies you need will depend on a variety of factors, like what your venue can provide, what your organizing team and volunteers already have access to, etc. There are some things every WordCamp seems to need, after which there’s no real use for them, so we’re starting to centralize purchase of some of these things and send them from one event to another. Right now these supplies are only being shipped within the U.S. due to prohibitive costs of international shipping, but we hope to expand this in the future.

### Lanyards and Badge Holders for Name Badges

You don’t need to budget for lanyards. WordPress Community Support can send an appropriate number of lanyards with clips based on the number of attendees. This is sent along with the swag that is shipped for your WordCamp. See the [handbook page on Swag](https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/wordcamp-organizer/planning-details/swag/) for more information.

You’ll still need to print the name badges and get badge holders. However, some badges don’t need a badge holder, especially if they come with holes to attach the lanyards.

If you are planning to organize an in-person WordPress event, we recommend you provide social distancing stickers to all attendees. We are currently working on getting them available, so they can be included in the welcome pack for new Meetup chapters and the swag pack for WordCamps.  
  
You can also [download the editable art print](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19DElUtapZ7penMz2qq3Hk-IQWghWYh_G?usp=sharing), to translate the stickers into your language and produce them locally.

### Office Supplies

There are a number of generic office supplies that you might need, but you might not. What should you buy? We’ll send you a box of miscellaneous supplies: each WordCamp adds its own leftover office supplies and then sends it to the next WordCamp in line (we’ll tell you which one). Typically these supplies include things like a stapler, post-its, sharpies, pens, reinforcements, tape, and scissors. Anything you think you’ll need that we didn’t send, go ahead and buy from your event budget. When your event is over, put the leftover supplies into the box, slap one of your event stickers on it, and send it to the next WordCamp.

### Electronics

In some cases, we will ship [video kits](https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/wordcamp-organizer/video/ "Video") to your WordCamp.
