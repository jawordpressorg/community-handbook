# Swag

> tl;dr: Swag isn’t an essential budget item, but it’s a nice-to-have item if you can secure sufficient local sponsorships. Stickers and [t-shirts](https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/wordcamp-organizer-handbook/planning-details/swag/#tees) are popular swag items, but other items such as mugs, glassware, hoodies, etc. are cool too. You can offer shirts in both straight AND fitted styles (sometimes called men’s/unisex and women’s sizes)!

### Requesting Swag from WordCamp Central

WordCamp Central will send you a package of WordPress swag that you should distribute for free at your WordCamp. The packs may vary based on supply, but usually include lanyards, buttons, and stickers.

About 8 weeks before your WordCamp’s scheduled date, an automated reminder will be emailed to you to confirm the shipping address for the swag package, as well as the number of attendees you are expecting. Please ensure you provide a detailed address, including a postal code and a phone number.

We try to send enough swag to cover everyone, but we recommend making this swag freely available on a table (or several tables) at the event rather than putting it in a bag and handing it out to all attendees, as this reduces the chance of people throwing it away because they don’t want it. Since every button costs 20 cents, we’d much rather they not be thrown away.

### Print WordPress Swag Locally

We’ve run into situations where our WordCamp organizers had to deal with customs and logistics companies to get swag on time for their events. So, we’re giving WordCamp Organizers the option to print WordPress stickers, buttons, and lanyards locally.

This way, WordCamp organizers can focus on event planning rather than dealing with shipments. It could also help us cut down on high shipping costs, import taxes, and other necessary expenses.

If you’re thinking of printing WordPress lanyards, buttons, and stickers locally, you should get some quotes from local vendors and make sure those costs are included in your approved WordCamp budget. You’ll find the right files for printing on the [Swag Source Files page](https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/wordcamp-organizer/planning-details/swag/swag-source-files/).

### Commemorative Swag

Most WordCamps also have their own commemorative swag, usually a [t-shirt](https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/wordcamp-organizer-handbook/planning-details/swag/#tees) and a sticker. If you can find a local printer to support your WordCamp by offering discounted services, yay! If not, we have some recommended vendors that have worked with many previous WordCamps. WordCamp Central will provide an official introduction and let these vendors know you are an approved WordCamp organizer if you would like to use their services:

If you do get anything custom printed, please send a photo of each to WordCamp Central after the event for the archive.

#### Pro Tips for Designing a Great WordCamp T-shirt

Do you want to design a WordCamp tee that will be universally beloved and worn all the time? Here’s some pro tips from experienced WordCamp organizers:

First: come up with a great graphic or logo that represents your WordCamp. Bonus if it can be printed in one color – this will save you lots of money.

Second: just print WordCamp stuff on your shirt. Over the years we have found people don’t wear shirts with sponsor logos.

Third, pick out a shirt brand that is soft and flattering. Cheap tees are cheap but also scratchy and generally unpopular, and people won’t wear uncomfortable shirts once the event is over. Having a fitted shirt style available is an important way to show women of any assigned sex that you think they belong at your WordCamp. In selecting t-shirts also make sure to pick a shirt in a color that is available across both unisex and women’s cut from XS to 5XL. There are some amazing colors available from S-XL or 2XL but sizes past that the colors are often restrictive. Some shirt makers will tell you that there is a close match, but I don’t recommend taking their word for it. If you’re working with Britni from Barefoot swag she’ll get samples for you to review.

Last expert tip, and ***very important***: print your awesome design on your awesome shirt in a place that flatters people will all sorts of body shapes. Lots of people have found that the ideal placement for a centered-chest print is less than 2 inches (5cm) below the collar, and in that case, it’s ideal to keep your logo height under 4 inches (10cm) and the width under 8 inches (20cm). Pocket placement can be easier to navigate, but of course, you end up with a smaller logo in that case.

### Covid Safety Stickers

If you are planning to organize an in-person WordPress event, we recommend you provide Covid Safety stickers to all attendees. We have them ready in our Swag Store. The stickers will be included in the swag packs sent to all WordCamps. If you need them for your Meetup events, please email support@wordcamp.org with your name, shipping address, and phone number.  
  
You can also [download the editable art print](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19DElUtapZ7penMz2qq3Hk-IQWghWYh_G?usp=sharing), to translate the stickers into your language and produce them locally.

### After Your WordCamp

If you have swag left over from the pack at the end of your event, encourage people to grab some on the way out, and gather up whatever is left. You can either keep it and distribute it at future meetups, or you can ship it back to WordCamp Central to be used for the next event.
