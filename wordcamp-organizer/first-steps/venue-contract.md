# Venue Contract

For any venue – particularly a hotel, wedding banquet, convention hall, or any other professional space – we want the organizers and the venue to prepare an official contract to be signed by both parties: the venue and WordPress Community Support, PBC (WPCS, PBC).

**Please, don’t sign the contract yourself. Make sure that only the venue signs the agreement, and then send it to [support@wordcamp.org](mailto:support@wordcamp.org) in one PDF document. A representative of WordPress Community Support, PBC will sign it and send it back to you.**

## Components of a complete contract:

1.  An official letterhead
2.  Addressed to:
    *   WordPress Community Support, PBC  
        660 4th Street #119  
        San Francisco  
        CA 94107

3.  Description of the items booked, as per the approved budget and the rate
4.  Venue cancellation policy
5.  Signed by the venue
6.  Sent to [support@wordcamp.org](mailto:support@wordcamp.org) in **one** PDF document (not as separate documents)

Some venues, such as schools, libraries, etc., might not have a procedure or template to create a formal contract that describes the booked venue package and cancellation policy and is signed by the venue. In such situations, please complete this [Simple Venue Agreement Template](https://href.li/?https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/wordcamp-organizer/first-steps/helpful-documents-and-templates/simple-venue-agreement-template/) and have it signed by the venue and WPCS, PBC.

## Why we require a signed contract before announcing the WordCamp date[](https://teamtardisp2.wordpress.com/team-documentation/wordcamp-venue-contracts/#why-we-require-a-signed-contract-before-announcing-the-wordcamp-date)

*   A signed venue contract is an official and legally binding document that we need in order to file an insurance claim if anything unexpected happens.
*   With a signed contract, the venue and WPCS accept some conditions in case of event cancellation, etc.
*   A contract signed by an international entity like WPCS elicits a bigger commitment from the venue.
