# Community Inclusion Initiatives

The WordPress community is diverse and global. The power of open source is that anyone can contribute from anywhere at any time, regardless of their background.

The more diverse our community is, the stronger it becomes. With different perspectives come new innovations, ideas, and solutions. Our diversity helps to create a more accessible user experience, whether that’s as a blogger setting up a site or a contributor to our community of in-person events and meetups.

Inclusive environments don’t happen overnight – or without effort. To fulfill WordPress’s mission to democratize publishing, the Community team seeks to actively reduce barriers to current and future participation, engagement, and sense of belonging in all WordPress events. This guide is a living document to support contributors in creating diverse, welcoming and inclusive WordPress communities.

For a quick start, view the [Building a Diverse Speaker Roster](https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/wordcamp-organizer/planning-details/speakers/building-a-diverse-speaker-roster/) handbook page and the [Encouraging Diversity in Meetups and WordCamps](https://make.wordpress.org/community/2020/06/23/tuesday-trainings-encouraging-diversity-in-meetups-and-wordcamps/) panel.

### Code of Conduct

The Code of Conduct (for [in-person events](https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/wordcamp-organizer/planning-details/code-of-conduct/) and [for virtual events](https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/virtual-events/online-code-of-conduct/)) is a living, community document that was adopted to help ensure safe meeting spaces for all community members. You are always welcome to provide input on and ask questions about the Code of Conduct in the [#community-team](https://make.wordpress.org/community/tag/community-team/) channel in the WordPress.org Slack.

### Diverse Speaker Training Group ([#WPDiversity](https://make.wordpress.org/community/tag/wpdiversity/))

The [Diverse Speaker Training group](https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/meetup-organizer/event-formats/diversity-speaker-training-workshop/) offers three programs:

**Diverse Speaker Training**: A live, [pre-recorded](https://learn.wordpress.org/workshop/diverse-speaker-training-workshop-part-1/), or interactive (hybrid of live and pre-recorded) workshop that empowers speakers whose identities are underrepresented in WordPress to overcome personal obstacles, develop, and deliver a WordCamp or meetup talk. This program aims to cultivate a diverse pool of prospective speakers for WordPress events. A recording of this workshop is available on Learn WordPress: [Part 1](https://learn.wordpress.org/workshop/diverse-speaker-training-workshop-part-1/), [Part 2](https://learn.wordpress.org/workshop/diverse-speaker-training-workshop-part-2/), [Part 3](https://learn.wordpress.org/workshop/diverse-speaker-training-workshop-part-3/), [Part 4](https://learn.wordpress.org/workshop/diverse-speaker-training-workshop-part-4/).

**Organizing Diverse & Inclusive WordPress Events workshop:** A [pre-recorded](https://learn.wordpress.org/workshop/creating-a-welcoming-and-diverse-space-part-1/) or interactive (hybrid of live and pre-recorded) workshop that empowers community members to cultivate welcoming and diverse WordPress events and communities. A recording of this workshop is available on Learn WordPress: [Part 1](https://learn.wordpress.org/workshop/creating-a-welcoming-and-diverse-space-part-1/) and [Part 2](https://learn.wordpress.org/workshop/creating-a-welcoming-and-diverse-space-part-2/). *All WordPress Meetup and WordCamp organizers are encouraged to complete this training!*

**Diverse Speaker Support**: A [Slack channel](https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C028SE81N3H) that brings together alumni of the above [#WPDiversity](https://make.wordpress.org/community/tag/wpdiversity/) trainings, speaker mentors, and WordPress event organizers. The purpose of this channel is to build meaningful community connections, provide ongoing support to diverse speakers as they develop talks and build confidence as speakers, and connect diverse speakers with speaking opportunities (for example, by sharing WordCamp calls for speakers, etc).

### do\_action 

[do\_action](https://doaction.org/) events are hackathons in which WordPress communities volunteer time and expertise to help local nonprofits develop an online presence, so as to be more impactful and effective in their work.

To organize a do\_action event in your area, follow the [do\_action guidelines and application process](https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/meetup-organizer/event-formats/do_action-charity-hackathon/) in the Meetup Organizer’s Handbook.

### Five for the Future

[Five for the Future](https://wordpress.org/five-for-the-future/) is a community initiative to encourage organizations to contribute five percent of their resources to WordPress development. Receiving sponsorship from an organization to contribute a certain amount of time to the WordPress community can help individuals from various backgrounds to participate in a way that may not have been accessible before.

If you’re an organization interested in donating time and resources to the community, check out the [Contribute as an Organization](https://wordpress.org/five-for-the-future/for-organizations/) page.

### Introduction to Open Source Workshops

In 2019, the WordPress Foundation organized an Introduction to Open Source workshop in Ghana, India, Colombia, and St. Lucia. The workshops are organized to help educate and engage potential contributors in regions where there is less participation in Open Source Projects.

While there are currently no upcoming workshops planned, interested organizers and participants can watch the [WordPress Foundation](https://wordpressfoundation.org/) website for updates. A [pre-recorded Introduction to Open Source workshop](https://learn.wordpress.org/workshop/introduction-to-open-source/) is also available.

### Youth Events 

Youth Events are locally-organized events dedicated to engaging and educating kids and young adults about WordPress. They provide an opportunity for young adults to learn more about open source software, technology, and community organizing; they provide parents and organizers with an opportunity to engage the next generation in tech.

If you’re interested in organizing a Youth Event in your area, please follow the [Organizer Handbook](https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/kidscamp-organizer/).
