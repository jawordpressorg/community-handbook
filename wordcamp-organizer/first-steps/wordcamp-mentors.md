# Event Mentors

With the new Community Team contributor role changes, event mentoring has become a task preformed by our Event Supporters and Program Supporters with event experience.

## Program Overview

This program is a great way for our event organizers to get structured support and guidance.

Once an event is approved and its website is create, the event organizer will be connected with their mentor through an email introduction.

Mentors and organizer decided how to meet, how often to meet, and who will participate. It can be just the mentor and organizer, the mentor and entire organizing, or some meeting can be a mix of both. It has worked well to meet every two weeks for the duration of the event planning, and then talking as often as necessary outside that schedule as needed.

When you meet, please be prepared to discuss the current status of the event, and prepare a list of any questions you have prior to your scheduled meeting times.

### The Mentor Role

Your mentor will be your first point of contact with questions that come up. Their involvement should be one of advisement on procedure and sharing of knowledge based on their history organizing WordCamps. Mentors are not to be considered one of your planning team and should not assign themselves or be assigned any actual planning tasks.

### Getting Help

As always, the volunteers at WordCamp Central will still be available for tricky questions in the [#community-events](http://wordpress.slack.com/messages/community-events/) channel on [WordPress Slack](https://make.wordpress.org/chat/), but we’re hoping to make peer mentoring our first line of awesomeness for WordCamp organizers.

## Becoming a Mentor

Interested in mentoring? Apply to become an Event Supporter or Program Supporter [here](https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/community-deputy/the-deputy-program/join-the-deputy-program/). Please note:

*   WordCamps can only be mentored by community members who have successfully lead a WordCamp from application to completion.
*   Rotating leadership roles are key in keeping healthy communities. With this in mind, please note that Event supporters (Mentors) should not mentor an event that they have previously participated in as an organizer. This is in order to enrich the current organizers with new knowledge and ideas.

If you have any questions about the mentorship program, please send us an email at [support@wordcamp.org](mailto:support@wordcamp.org).
