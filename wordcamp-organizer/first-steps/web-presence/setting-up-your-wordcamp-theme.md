# Setting up Your WordCamp Theme

To get started with your WordCamp theme, you’ll want to log in and head over to the Appearance menu and pick out one of the installed themes, then activate it on your site. After that, you can start to customize it with CSS. There are three options, depending on your needs and your experience with CSS:

1.  [The Remote CSS tool](https://make.wordpress.org/community/2015/11/24/remote-css-plugin-launched-on-wordcamp-org/) – This is the best option if you want to make a lot of changes, or if you have an advanced developer on your team.
2.  [Jetpack’s Custom CSS module](http://jetpack.me/support/custom-css/) – This is the easiest option if you have a developer, but only need to make a few tweaks.
3.  [The Site Cloner tool](https://make.wordpress.org/community/2015/07/09/site-cloner-v1-is-now-available/) – This is the best option for camps that don’t have a developer, since you can just copy another camp’s design.

For security and maintainability, [we can’t allow custom PHP or JavaScript code](https://make.wordpress.org/community/2015/06/10/allowing-custom-php-and-javascript-on-wordcamp-org/), but if you have a need that the current tools don’t meet, you can request a solution that all camps can benefit from, and even [contribute it yourself](https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/wordcamp-organizer-handbook/first-steps/web-presence/contributing-to-wordcamp-org/).

## Coming Soon

By default, vistors will see a Coming Soon page instead of your live site. This gives you the chance to add some default content and customize your theme before launching the site. Keep in mind that **any posts that you publish will be sent to subscribers**, though.

When you’re ready to launch the site, just visit *Settings > Coming Soon* to disable the feature.

## Local Development Sandboxes

If you plan on making a lot of CSS customizations to your theme, you may want to [setup a local sandbox](https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/wordcamp-organizer-handbook/first-steps/web-presence/setting-up-your-wordcamp-theme/setting-up-a-local-wordcamp-org-sandbox/) so that you can preview them.

## Theme Options and Customization

If you’re using the WordCamp Base theme, it has several theme options that allow you to drastically change the arrangement of the theme. Unless noted otherwise, all options are located on the **Theme Options** page under the **Appearance** menu.

You can easily alter the **grid width** or alter the layout of the theme. The **Theme Layout** section controls the width of each section of the theme, and will add/remove widget areas based on your settings.

To add a **register button**, make sure *“Show a featured button in the menu.”* is checked. You can then provide text and a URL for the button.

## Web Fonts

You can add web fonts by browsing to the Appearance > Fonts menu. If there’s a popular collection of open-source fonts that you’d like to use, but it isn’t available, let us know and we’ll try to add it.
