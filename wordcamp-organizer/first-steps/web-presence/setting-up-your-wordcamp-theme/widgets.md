# Widgets

In addition to the widgets included in WordPress Core, there are several others available to you.

## WordCamp-specific Content

*   **Speakers, Sessions, and Organizers** – These will all show a list of their corresponding posts.
*   **Sponsors** – This will show all of the sponsors, grouped by their sponsorship level. Make sure that you visit the Order Sponsor Levels page under the Sponsors menu in order to set the levels according to how much they contributed, with multi-event sponsors at the top.  
    (**Note**: Do you have an [Ad Blocker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_blocking) enabled in your browser? It’s common for ad blockers to hide the sponsors widget on wordcamp sites, because it looks to them like a bunch of ads).

## Mailing Lists and E-mail Notifications

*   **Jetpack Subscriptions** – Visitors can enter their address to receive an e-mail whenever you publish a new post.
*   **MailChimp** – You can obtain the Campaign URL from your MailChimp list settings; it will look something like *http://your-account-name.us6.list-manage.com/subscribe/?u=323j308f1d2sdfa3c35823dsa&id=ccfd8b6e5*
*   **Campaign Monitor** – You can obtain the Campaign URL from your Campaign Monitor list settings; it will look something like *http://username.createsend.com/t/t/s/sjlk/*
*   **Subscribe to Specific Post** – This will let visitors enter their e-mail address on specific posts/pages/etc and receive e-mail notifications when the contents of that post change. Configuration options are located in the *Settings* menu, under *Email Post Changes.*
