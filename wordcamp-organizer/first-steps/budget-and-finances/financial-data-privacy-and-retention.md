# Financial Data Privacy and Retention

The global community team uses WordCamp.org sites to budget, track, and log event expenses related to WordPress community events. This page has information on how that works.

### Entity and fiscal team

The WordPress global community team uses the [WordPress Foundation’s](http://wordpressfoundation.org/) subsidiary corporation, [WordPress Community Support PBC](https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/wordcamp-organizer/first-steps/budget-and-finances/running-the-money-through-wpcs/#how-does-this-work). A group of financial administrators,  volunteers who review and process payment and reimbursement requests currently includes: Angela Jin, Erica Varlese, Hari Shanker, and Naoko Takano. Harmony Romo also provides bookkeeping support.

### Sponsor invoices and revenue

As the volunteer team recruits local sponsors, they enter the sponsors’ address and contact information into the Sponsors tool, and then request that WPCS invoice the sponsor. When a volunteer presses the “send” button on a sponsor invoice request, the request is then sent to a network admin queue. A community team deputy reviews the request and approves it, which then sends the invoice information to QuickBooks Online. An invoice is emailed to the sponsor via QuickBooks Online, and a PDF copy of that invoice is also sent to the volunteer who requested that the sponsor be invoiced.

A financial administrator reviews all revenue accounts daily, and attributes income to sponsor invoices in Quickbooks Online. Once an invoice is marked Paid in Quickbooks, the status of the sponsor invoice listing on the WordCamp site is also changed to Paid, and the volunteer who requested the invoice receives an email, notifying them of the change in status. Sponsor contact information is held indefinitely in QuickBooks, for tax and audit purposes, as well as in the WordCamp site.

### Payment requests and reimbursements

When a volunteer needs to request payment for a vendor, or request reimbursement for an approved WordCamp-related expense, they can fill out a [vendor payment request](https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/wordcamp-organizer/first-steps/budget-and-finances/submitting-payment-requests/) or a [reimbursement request](https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/wordcamp-organizer/first-steps/budget-and-finances/reimbursement-requests/). All financial and personal details are encrypted. Financial and personal details are only visible by the volunteer requesting the funds, plus the financial administrators who review the payment or reimbursement and execute payment. After a funding request is marked “Paid,” the financial and personal data included in the request is deleted.

If you have questions about the handling or retention of personal or financial data on wordcamp.org, please [email us](mailto:support@wordcamp.org?Subject=Data%Privacy%inquiry) and we’ll be happy to answer your questions.
