# Vendor Payments

*Ready to start requesting payments for your WordCamp?*

> Is this request for payment a reimbursement? If so, stop right now and head on over to [Reimbursement Requests](https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/wordcamp-organizer-handbook/first-steps/budget-and-finances/reimbursement-requests/) instead. ðŸ™‚ We have a different set of information we collect for reimbursement requests.

When requesting payment of vendors please keep in mind that Wire and ACH transfers are the fastest and most reliable ways to get your vendor paid (when the correct information is provided). Checks are also an excellent way to pay your vendors. ***Note that Checks and ACH/Direct Deposits are only available within the United States.***

Wires, ACH transfers, and checks are all part of an automated system of payments that are easily processed and tracked on our end. For both efficiency and keeping track of payments these are our preferred methods.

It is also possible for vendors to be paid using credit cards, though this is not a preferred method. Because of time required, and the high risk of fraudulent charges, we use this only when absolutely necessary.

Vendor payment requests are made from the comfort of your very own WordCamp dashboard.

From here you can choose to create a new request or see all submitted requests for your WordCamp.

### Submitting a Payment Request

Letâ€™s walk through submitting a new payment request. Make sure youâ€™ve gathered your invoice and all vendor and payment details before you get started.

First weâ€™ll enter the general information:

And now payment details.Â You can request payment by Wire, Direct Deposit (ACH), Check, or Credit card.

### Requesting Payment by Direct Deposit (ACH Transfer)

Direct Deposit is available for payments made to banks in the United States only. For non-US banks, please request a Wire transfer. You will need the bank name, routing number, account number, account holder name, and if the account is a personal or company account.

### Requesting Payment by Check

Checks are available for payments made in the United States only. For non-US payments, please request a Wire transfer. When requesting payment by check, be certain to note who the check should be made payable to, in some cases this is different than the vendorâ€™s name.

### Requesting Payment by Credit Card

Because of time required, and the high risk of fraudulent charges, we only make credit card payments when there is absolutely no other way for the vendor to receive payment. If youâ€™re requesting payment byÂ credit card, please provide a Payment Link or Credit Card Authorization Form. There is a blank [credit card authorization form template](https://make.wordpress.org/community/files/2018/07/CREDIT-CARD-AUTHORIZATION-FORM.pdf) that you can use.

### Requesting Payment by Wire Transfer

If youâ€™re requesting payment by wire youâ€™ll need the following details for the vendor:

Beneficiaryâ€™s Bank:  
Beneficiaryâ€™s Bank Address:  
Beneficiaryâ€™s Bank SWIFT BIC:  
Beneficiaryâ€™s IBAN or Account Number:  
Beneficiaryâ€™s Name:  
Beneficiaryâ€™s Address:  
**  
\*IMPORTANT NOTE: if you have the IBAN number of the vendor, you can use the website https://www.iban.com/ to get all the above fields needed to submit the payment request**

Fill out the vendor details. Vendor name, address, and telephone number are all required. But itâ€™s always good to list a contact name and email address when possible.

Attach all supporting documentation. An invoice is the most common document but you can also upload contracts to be signed, credit card authorizations, bank documents, and any other document relevant to your payment request. Any payment requests sent without documentation will be delayed until required documentation has been received.Â  You can also enter any additional notes here.

After youâ€™ve filled out all the fields pertaining to your request and uploaded your supporting documentation itâ€™s time to submit your payment request.

[![Screen Shot 2015-06-30 at 4.12.41 PM](https://make.wordpress.org/community/files/2015/06/Screen-Shot-2015-06-30-at-4.12.41-PM.png)](https://make.wordpress.org/community/files/2015/06/Screen-Shot-2015-06-30-at-4.12.41-PM.png)

Payments requests are processed Monday through Friday (except on US Bank Holidays). Please note that it takes up to 10 days from the date it is issued for a check to arrive with the payee so plan ahead. You can view the status of all your payment requests from the All Payment Requests screen. Payment date and other details will be recorded once paid byÂ WordCamp Central.

### Payment Statuses

**Draft**: The payment is still editable by WordCamp organizers and has not been submitted for payment.

**Incomplete**: The information submitted in the payment request wasnâ€™t enough for Central to make the payment. More information has been requested from the person who authored the payment request.

**Pending Approval**: The payment has been submitted to Central for payment; a deputy will review the request against the approved budget and approve it for payment.

**Approved**: The payment has been reviewed against the approved budget and will be paid by Central.

**Payment Sent**: This status means different things depending on the method of payment.

*   Check: the check was issued but has not been cashed.
*   Credit card: the credit card number has been provided to the vendor
*   Wire: the wire information has been submitted to the bank for payment
*   Direct Deposit: the ACH transfer information has been submitted to the bank for payment

**Paid**: The money has left our account and, to the best of our knowledge, gone to the vendor. If a check, the check was cashed. If a wire or direct deposit, the money was accepted by the beneficiary bank.

**Failed**: The wire transfer or direct deposit was not accepted by the beneficiary bank.

**Cancelled**: The payment was cancelled by WordCamp Central (usually due to an organizerâ€™s request).
