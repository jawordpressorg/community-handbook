# Running the money through WordPress Community Support, PBC

All WordCamp organizing teams are asked to keep their event budget in their WordCamp dashboard (Budget > Budget). In the US and Canada, WordCamps use the financial backing of the entity called WordPress Community Support, PBC (a Public Benefit Corporation that is the financial and legal support for official WordPress events) to manage the money involved with their event. Outside the US and Canada, we offer the use of WPCS as a legal and financial entity to organizers if they wish to take advantage of it.

### How does this work?

WordCamps using the legal and financial backing of WordPress Community Support, PBC collect sponsorship and ticket revenue through WPCS accounts (invoicing from WPCS and using the WPCS PayPal account that‚Äôs already connected to the WordCamp registration plugin, CampTix), and then submits all vendor invoices to WordCamp Central for payment from WPCS accounts. WordCamp Central essentially functions as the WordCamp‚Äôs ‚Äúaccounts receivable‚Äù and ‚Äúaccounts payable‚Äù department. üôÇ [Here is a page](https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/wordcamp-organizer/first-steps/budget-and-finances/wordpress-community-support-wordpress-foundation-entity-structure/) that explains the structures of WPCS and WPF.

Once a WordCamp budget has been approved by a community deputy, there is no need for a WordCamp to raise a certain amount of money before submitting invoices to pay venue deposits or other up-front expenses. Each WordCamp budget is kept up to date in the WordCamp dashboard, and [sponsor invoices](https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/wordcamp-organizer-handbook/first-steps/budget-and-finances/creating-sponsor-invoices/) and [vendor payments](https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/wordcamp-organizer/first-steps/budget-and-finances/submitting-payment-requests/) are managed through the tools on each WordCamp site dashboard.

Surplus funds from WordCamps are retained by WordPress Community Support for the support of other official WordPress community events and programs, including local meetup and user group events.

WordPress Community Support, PBC is a separate entity from the WordPress Foundation ([read about the distinction between the two entities here](https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/wordcamp-organizer/first-steps/budget-and-finances/wordpress-community-support-wordpress-foundation-entity-structure/)). The purpose of WPCS is not to make a profit, but rather to benefit WordPress community programs. However, the PBC is taxed as a for-profit corporation by the IRS. This means most WordCamps and Meetup groups cannot take advantage of most non-profit discounts from vendors.
