# Sponsor agreements

**Most sponsors will not need a sponsor agreement, but there are some cases when one is required:**  
**– If the sponsorship package is an amount higher of $10k**  
**– If it’s a legal requirement of the sponsor’s country (like the case of SiteGround)**

In those cases, please follow these steps to create a sponsor agreement:

1) Go to your WordCamp site’s dashboard and click on the menu: ‘Docs’

2) Select “Sponsorship Agreement” on the dropdown and click on the blue button “Next” (see image above)

3) Fill in all the fields required for creating the agreement (ask the sponsor to provide their details for the first three fields), and click on the blue button “Download PDF”

4) Open the PDF and make sure all details are correct, send it via email to support@wordcamp.org requesting a signature from a member of the Global Community Team with permission to sign on behalf of WordPress Community Support PBC (WPCS)

5) As soon as you receive the agreement signed by WPCS, send it to the sponsor requesting signature

6) Upload the signed sponsorship agreement on Budget > Sponsor Invoices > [following this quick tutorial](https://make.wordpress.org/community/2017/08/10/uploading-sponsorship-agreements/)

And all done! 🙂
