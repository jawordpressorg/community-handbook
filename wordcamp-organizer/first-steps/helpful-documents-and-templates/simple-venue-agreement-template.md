# Simple Venue Agreement Template

Sometimes WordCamps are held at art galleries, union halls, and other places that don’t regularly rent out their space. If you need to provide a [venue agreement](https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/wordcamp-organizer/first-steps/venue-contract/) for the space you plan to rent, you can use this template.

**Please, make sure that only the venue signs it, and then send it to support@wordcamp.org in one PDF document. A representative of WordPress Community Support, PBC will sign it and send it back to you.**

The agreement is necessary for the global insurance to cover the event, please make always sure that the venue signs the agreement even if they offer the space for free. You can edit the template as needed, if you have any doubts, please reach out to the community team in the [#community-events](https://make.wordpress.org/community/tag/community-events/) Slack channel. This apply to all WordCamps, Next-Gen events, and other new event formats.
