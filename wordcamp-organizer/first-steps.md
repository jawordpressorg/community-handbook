# First Steps

Once you’ve been approved as an organizer, there are a few things you’ll need to do before your WordCamp will be added to the official schedule.

*   [Put together an organizing team](https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/wordcamp-organizer-handbook/first-steps/the-organizing-team/ "The Organizing Team").
*   [Find a venue and a date](https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/wordcamp-organizer-handbook/first-steps/venue-and-date/ "Venue and Date").
*   [Create a preliminary budget](https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/wordcamp-organizer-handbook/first-steps/budget-and-finances/ "Budget and Finances").
*   [Send your budget to WordCamp Central for review.](mailto:support@wordcamp.org)
*   [Set up your wordcamp.org website](https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/wordcamp-organizer-handbook/first-steps/web-presence/setting-up-your-wordcamp-theme/ "WordCamp.org Website").

Keep in touch with WordCamp Central during your early planning stages. If you get stuck trying to find a venue or filling out your organizing team, we might be able to help. If you have made absolutely no progress in finding a venue after 3 months after approval for pre-planning, your WordCamp will come off the WordCamp Central planning list. The field will then be open for other community members to join and help activate the stalled team, or apply to organize a WordCamp with a new team, with heavy preference given to the former.

If a WordCamp organizing team sets a date and books a venue but then fails to update/interact with the community for more than a month during the planning period, then WordCamp Central will contact that team and try to help them get back on track. If the organizing team can’t make progress in the next month, the team will be asked to either add more organizers who can help correct the course or postpone/reschedule their event.
