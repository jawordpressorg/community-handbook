# Welcome

WordCamps are casual, locally-organized conferences that focus on everything WordPress. Each WordCamp is different, reflecting the local WordPress community it represents, and often includes a wide range of people from casual users to core developers participate, share ideas, and get to know each other.

This handbook gives community members a playbook to help guide them through organizing WordCamps in their area. It covers information like:

*   [how to become an organizer](https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/wordcamp-organizer/become-an-organizer/)
*   [the first things to do once you start planning](https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/wordcamp-organizer/first-steps/)
*   [some of the more detailed aspects of planning, like fundraising and providing food](https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/wordcamp-organizer/planning-details/)
*   [things to consider during the event](https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/wordcamp-organizer/during-wordcamp/)
*   [what do when it’s all over](https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/wordcamp-organizer/after-its-over/)
*   and much more!

If you find there’s information that you need that is missing from this handbook, please mention it in the [#community-team](https://make.wordpress.org/community/tag/community-team/) channel on Making WordPress Slack or email support@wordcamp.org.
