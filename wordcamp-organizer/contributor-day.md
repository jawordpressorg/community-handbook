# Planning a Contributor Day

You will find the complete handbook for organising a Contributor Day [in the contributor day handbook](https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/contributor-day/contributor-days/). You will also find more info on organizing a contributor day [over here in the Meetup Organizer Handbook](https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/meetup-organizer/event-formats/contributor-day/).

### Budget

If youâ€™re planning to do a Contributor Day as part of your WordCamp, donâ€™t forget to add all the expenses related to the Contributor Day to the preliminary [budget](https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/wordcamp-organizer/first-steps/budget-and-finances/) before submitting it. If you have any questions, donâ€™t hesitate to ask in the [#community-events](https://make.wordpress.org/chat/) channel or to your mentor ðŸ™‚

### Stickers

We have Contributor Badge Stickers that we send to WordCamps hosting Contributor Days. When [requesting your WordCampâ€™s swag](https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/wordcamp-organizer/planning-details/swag/#requesting-swag), please be sure to let WordCamp Central know how many attendees you expect for your contributor day so we can order an appropriate amount of stickers for your event!
