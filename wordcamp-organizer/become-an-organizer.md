## An Overview of WordCamps

WordCamps are casual, locally-organized conferences that focus on everything WordPress. Each WordCamp is different, reflecting the local WordPress community it represents, and often includes a wide range of people from casual users to core developers participate, share ideas, and get to know each other.

### About the approval process

In this section, we cover what it takes to get approved as a WordCamp organizer. Note that we usually approve one primary organizer, and it is then up to that person to put together an appropriate team of co-organizers.

### When multiple people apply from one city

Occasionally we’ll get applications from multiple people at the same time for the same city, and we’ll ask them to work together. In that case, you usually will still need to put together a bigger organizing team, and should elect one person to be the primary organizer/main point of contact for WordCamp Central.

### Where meetups and WordCamps connect

It is generally considered that ongoing meetup groups are the lifeblood of the local WordPress community, and that WordCamps are their annual celebrations. If there is an active meetup group in your city but you do not participate, it is unlikely you will be approved as the primary organizer of the annual event, so you should start attending the meetups first.

If there is no meetup group yet, you will probably be prompted to try and start one. Bringing people together over a shared love of WordPress will give us more confidence that you can bring together a bigger community at WordCamp.

## Guidelines Build Trust

Because WordCamps are approved by the WordPress Community Support, PBC, each event — though unique — follows some basic guidelines and standards, to ensure that WordCamp attendees know [what to expect](http://central.wordcamp.org/what-to-expect/) when attending [a WordCamp near them](http://central.wordcamp.org/schedule/).

It’s important to note that these guidelines have been developed in response to feedback from WordPress community members to make organizing simpler and events consistent and safe.

As WordPress continues to become more popular, it’s become necessary to be more careful when granting permission to use the trademark in order to prevent confusion about what sites, companies, people, and events are officially part of the WordPress project. When people see an event on WordCamp.org, they know it can be trusted to live up to their expectations and accurately represent WordPress.
