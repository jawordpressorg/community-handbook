# Regional WordCamps

A Regional WordCamp is a WordCamp that represents the WordPress communities in a geographical area larger than one city/metro area.

Regional WordCamps can be a great way to bring a community together to celebrate, represent, and grow local WordPress communities in a region or country. As such, they contribute to the primary goal for the WordPress Global Community Team: to support the creation and growth of WordPress meetup groups and annual WordCamps in as many cities as possible in the world. 

## Goals and Requirements for Hosting a Regional Camp

The intent is always for regional WordCamps to connect people who weren’t already active in their local WordPress community and inspire attendees to start communities in their hometowns. Connect. Inspire. Contribute.

**Goals for regional WordCamps:**

*   Inspire local organizers to grow and/or energize local communities and local events.
*   Encourage consistent local events across the region, meaning regular meetups and WordCamps in multiple cities.
*   Foster local organizer representation and turnover, building a healthy community that brings in new people.
*   Cultivate WordCamps with a focus on diversity and inclusion.

**Regional WordCamps are required to:**

*   Have organizers from multiple areas in the region. The larger the WordCamp, the more organizers that will be needed.
*   Have an active meetup in the city where it’s being held or a meetup that is being reactivated while planning the WordCamp.
*   Move from city to city each year.
*   Place importance on diversity and inclusion among speakers, sponsors, and volunteers (this includes representation across age, gender, sexual orientation, class, etc.).
*   Maintain two-year terms for lead organizers.

**Applying for a regional WordCamp:** Regional WordCamps do not need to go through additional steps, and can directly apply to organize a camp for their region using the [regular WordCamp application form](https://central.wordcamp.org/wordcamp-organizer-application/).

Regional WordCamp applications will continue to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis by WordCamp Central deputies, based on the above criteria.

## Common FAQs

**I live in a small country, why do you suggest we have multiple WordCamps?**

Travel can be difficult for many different people. For some, having a WordCamp that’s even an hour away can prevent them from attending. Local WordCamps, no matter the size of the country they’re in, allow more opportunities for a wider range of community members to participate.

**I thought we could have regional WordCamps after the pandemic! What happened?**

Some countries and regions are using regional WordCamps to kick-start events after the pandemic in an effort to get their local communities excited and engaged again. As long as the goals and requirements described below are fully understood and followed, communities can host regional WordCamps in the future.

We are always happy to discuss your WordCamp plans with you. Simply email [support@wordcamp.org](mailto:support@wordcamp.org) as needed.

**Isn’t it better to have bigger, regional events? Why are you stopping us?**

Bigger isn’t always better, and sometimes “bigger” creates new challenges for a community. Large WordCamps can be overwhelming and complicated to plan, making it difficult to find new organizers willing to help out. 

Smaller WordCamps often provide more opportunity for impactful relationship building with an easier to repeat structure. They’re also less intimidating, and can be more comfortable for new people. If done well, they increase diversity because they are more accessible. They’re great places to safely build up to more community involvement. And, they can be great places to innovate and try new formats!

After all, it’s the content and connections that matter, not the number of attendees.
