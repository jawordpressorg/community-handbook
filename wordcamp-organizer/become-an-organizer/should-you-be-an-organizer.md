# Should You Be an Organizer?

> **tl;dr:** If you want to organize a WordCamp, [apply here](https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/wordcamp-organizer-handbook/become-an-organizer/organizer-application/ "Organizer Application")! Successful applicants are already active in their local WP community where they want to organize an event and understand that organizing is a volunteer, group effort.

Local organizers are what make each WordCamp unique. Organizing a WordCamp is a volunteer labor of love for WordPress and your local community.

If you’ve never organized a large event before, we suggest that you start by organizing a WordPress meetup first for a few months. This helps gauge community interest, allows you to make contacts with the local WordPress community, and provides you with some low-key event planning experience. 

## A Few Facts

**Organizing Teams:** WordCamp organizing teams should have 5-10 members, and preferably will include a variety of people from the meetup group, not just one company, school, or group of friends. Inclusion and transparency should be the bywords from start to finish.

**Approved by the Community team:** WordCamp organizers and events are approved by the WordPress Community team, a group of global community members who work together to promote WordPress through events around the world.

**For the Benefit of the Entire Community:** WordCamps are meant to benefit the local WordPress community through live events and the broader WordPress community through the sharing of online video and other materials. They are not-for-profit events.

**Leftover funds:** Leftover funds from a WordCamp budget should be discussed with your mentor and WordPress Community Support.

Excess funds are not to be pocketed by the organizers; organizers are considered community volunteers. If you are interested in putting together a for-profit WordPress conference, you should do so under another brand, as this is not allowed under the WordCamp brand.
