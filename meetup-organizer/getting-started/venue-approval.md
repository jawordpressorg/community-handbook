# Meetup Venue Approval Request

WordPress Community Support will cover the costs of a meetup venue if a donated venue cannot be found. If you are going to ask for WordPress Community Support to cover the costs of a meetup venue, the following conditions must be met:

*   Your group is on the WordPress chapter account at meetup.com or has been similarly recognized as official by this team.
*   Your group is currently following the [5 good-faith rules](https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/meetup-organizer/meetup-program-basics/#the-five-good-faith-rules).
*   You are unable to find a donated venue.
*   Your proposed new venue meets minimum requirements for safety, adequate seating, and accessibility.

You should also avoid venues with religious or political affiliations. Since one of our jobs as community organizers is to create a 100% welcoming space for everyone, we avoid holding events in venues where someone might feel uncomfortable or unwelcome.

If those items are all met, we ask for a 3-6 month invoice and commitment; and please ask the venue if they will offer a discount for paying for 6 months up front. Please submit the venue invoice to support@wordcamp.org. Include your meetup location, venue contact name, contact’s email address and phone number, and any special payment information. Unless otherwise specified, venues will be paid by check. You should expect a response in about a week.
