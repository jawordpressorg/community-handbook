In order to book a Zoom account, we will need to see that the event has been scheduled. Please also fill out the following form.

[Submit a form.](https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/meetup-organizer/getting-started/special-virtual-events-zoom-request/)

A deputy will review your request and respond. Access to Zoom accounts will be provided at least 3 days in advance of your event, and will be removed shortly after.
