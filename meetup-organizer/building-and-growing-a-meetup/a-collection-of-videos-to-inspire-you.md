## The WordPress and Open Source Philosophy

WordPress is a free and open source software used to build websites and blogs also called as “CMS” (Content Management System) which is available at WordPress.org. You don’t have to be a coder to use WordPress and being open source helps. It has one of the largest open source communities and WordPress now powers [43% of all the websites](https://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/content_management) on the internet. Four open-source principles:

*   The freedom to use the software for any purpose.
*   The freedom to change the software to suit your needs.
*   The freedom to share the software with your friends and neighbours.
*   The freedom to share the changes you make.
