# Stepping Down as a Meetup Organizer

If you are struggling with your meetup group and need help, email [support@wordcamp.org](mailto:support@wordcamp.org).

**Are you no longer able to organize a meetup? We understand and we’re here to help. This page will guide you through the process of stepping down as the organizer of your meetup.**

### 1: Contact Your Group Members

*   **If you have co-organizers,** please inform them that you will be stepping down.
*   **If you are the only organizer,** try at least one of these methods to recruit a new organizer.
    *   Message your meetup group members. Let them know that you are stepping down and ask if someone else would like to become a new organizer or co-organizer. If you’re unsure what to say, we have a template below you can use.
    *   Post the same message on your group’s Discussions board.
    *   Ask past event volunteers who may be interested. Direct outreach tends to be more successful and it’s a great way to encourage a new leader who otherwise wouldn’t step up.
*   If you are successful in finding a new organizer, have them email [support@wordcamp.org](mailto:support@wordcamp.org) so they can begin the onboarding process.

**Note: you do not need to tell your group members why you are stepping down.** That is your personal information and your choice to make. However, notifying them of the change is a friendly way to end your time with them and to bring closure to the community.

### 2: Notify WordPress Community Support (WC Central)

*   Email [support@wordcamp.org](mailto:support@wordcamp.org) to let us know that you will be stepping down.
*   If you are uncomfortable messaging your meetup group, tell us in the email and we will contact the group directly in an effort to recruit a new organizer.

### 3: Remove Yourself as Organizer

*   **Follow the** [**Step Down as Organizer**](https://help.meetup.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002882191-Stepping-down-as-the-organizer-of-a-group) **instructions** from meetup.com.
*   You can continue as a member of the group, and are welcome to return to organizing should you wish to in the future.
*   **Make sure WordPress is still listed as an organizer.**

### 4: Consider Becoming a Meetup Mentor!

We are beginning a mentor program for meetup groups, and we need experienced community members like you who are looking for a new adventure. If you are interested in becoming a mentor, simply let us know either in your initial email or with a follow up email to [support@wordcamp.org](mailto:support@wordcamp.org).

If you are uncomfortable messaging your meetup group, please let WordCamp Central know (by emailing [support@wordcamp.org](mailto:support@wordcamp.org)) and we will contact the group directly in an effort to recruit a new organizer.

## After You Step Down

From here, any remaining co-organizers will continue as usual.

If there are no remaining co-organizers, WordPress Community Support will work to find a new co-organizer for the meetup. If you’re interested, you can learn more about this process on the handbook page [“When a Group Leaves the Chapter Program.”](https://href.li/?https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/meetup-organizer/when-a-group-leaves-the-chapter-program/)

Finally, **thank you** for the time you spent nurturing your meetup and working to grow the open source community. 

## Template for Contacting your Group

**\[SUBJECT LINE\] Important: New group organizer(s) needed!**

Hi \[LOCATION\] WordPress meetup members,

I will no longer be able to organize the group, and could use your help in finding a replacement.

If you, as a member, would be interested in filling the organizer role, please email me at \[ORGAIZER’S EMAIL\] and CC support@wordcamp.org. We’d love to hear from you and will help with next steps.

Ideally, multiple members will team up as co-organizers, and we welcome all who are interested to reply by \[DATE TWO WEEKS AWAY\]. If no one is found, the group will be deactivated.

\[ORGANIZER’S  NAME\]
