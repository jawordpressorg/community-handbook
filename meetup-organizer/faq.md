# Meetup Organizer FAQ

### Can a WordPress Meetup chapter group provide receipts to attendees?

In case you need to issue receipts to attndees, please consult your local tax code to check 1) if it's legal for a voluntary group like Meetup group to do so, and 2) how the receipts should be formatted and recods to be kept.

For example, only institutions with VAT ID can issue receipts within the EU. In other countries and areas, you may need to address the document with a responsible person's name instead of the name of a group.


### I'm not sure if fully understand the GPL and what it entails. What CAN and CAN'T I do?

At WordPress Meetup events, you can show support to individuals and organizations that are fully enbracing <a href="https://wordpress.org/about/philosophy/">WordPress' open source philosophy</a> by releasing and promoting 100% GPL products.

On the other hand, you can't do the same for those who choose to license their products with non-GPL compatible licenses and a split license.

The <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/wordcamp-organizer/planning-details/gpl-primer/">GPL Primer</a> article is a great one to get started. You can use <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/wordcamp-organizer/first-steps/helpful-documents-and-templates/100-gpl-vetting-checklist/">this vetting checklist</a> to see if a certain WordPress-related product or service is 100% GPL.
