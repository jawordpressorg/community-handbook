Meetups are locally-organized groups that meet for events on a regular basis (commonly once a month) and power year-round WordPress communities. They are a vital part of the overall WordPress open source project.

This handbook contains information to help community members start and grow meetups inside the **WordPress Chapter Meetup Program**. Curious about this program?
