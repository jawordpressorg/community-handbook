# Promoting your Meetup

Promoting a WordPress Meetup is so much more than setting up a Meetup page. The Marketing Team has crowdsourced some of the things that have worked. We hope that this advice is helpful. Please note that these are suggestions, not requirements. Every community has their own nuance and flavor.

Each Meetup should have a static, repeatable event message that gets edited when a speaker or special event is planned. Also, will newcomers understand what your Meetup is about? How about new-to-WordPress people? Is it a class or a discussion? Have fresh eyes take a look at your Meetup page. Would a newcomer be able to easily find all information?

Familiarity eases anxiety for new people. Be sure Meetup organizers are included in, distinguishable, and tagged on group photos, when possible. Familiar faces and knowing who’s “in charge” diminish social anxiety for many.

Here are some suggestions from the Marketing Team ([Original Community Blog Post](https://make.wordpress.org/community/2017/08/03/promoting-your-local-wordpress-meetup/))

## WordPress Meetup Tips & Tricks

1.  **Blog** after each event on your WordPress Meetup’s web property.
    *   Post on Facebook Page.
    *   Tweet.
2.  Make the event on a **consistent** basis, regardless of attendance (3 or more works, etc.)
3.  Make the event **known** (ie announce the Meetup) on Meetup.com at least two weeks in advance. Chapter Meetup events are visible in the WordPress dashboard (after 4.8), so the title of your Meetup becomes very important.
4.  If you don’t have a Facebook Page for the Group and/or Facebook Group, Twitter, then post on your own Facebook Profile.
5.  Consider creating **Social Media accounts** for your Meetup
    *   Twitter
    *   Facebook Page
    *   Pinterest
6.  Get **support from other local Meetups** specially Open Source project Meetups. It helps if organizers or members attend other Meetups, too.
    *   JavaScript Meetups
    *   PHP Meetups
    *   UX/Usability Meetups
    *   Digital Marketing Meetups
7.  Taking **group photos** after the event or during the event and then posting on social helps with people feeling included. Ask for volunteer Meetup members to take photos, great way to get them involved! Also, make sure Meetup organizers are included in, distinguishable and tagged on group photos when possible. Familiar faces and knowing who’s “in charge” diminishes social anxiety for some. Perhaps feature organizers in a banner image on the Meetup page.
8.  **Weeknight meetings** that have a **meal** provided help with attendance — especially those coming straight from work or who have child-care issues.
9.  Be sure to comment on the Meetup event when someone says they can’t make it or whatever. **Pay attention to those Meetup.com notifications.**
10.  After the Meetup click **“good to see you”** for everyone who was there.
11.  **Greet people when they enter**. If you have more than one organizer this can help a lot with making people feel welcome — especially new people.
12.  Make sure your own (as an organizer and/or attendee) **Meetup profile** is filled out (with a recent photo).
13.  When you are launching one of the things you want to consider is creating **campaigns** so people can join the event.
14.  Ask **speakers** to **promote** their upcoming Meetup talk/presentation/workshop on their site and social media accounts.
15.  Include a **banner image** on your WordCamp showcasing Meetup organizers or a post introducing the link between Meetup and the WordCamp which shows the organizers the day of or before the WordCamp starts.
16.  **Filming** presentations held in the Meetup and posting them on YouTube (or even a closed Facebook group) can be helpful for promotion. Even a 1-minute video posted showing what things happened at the meeting can help.
