# Incident Reporting

To report a code of conduct\-related issue, email [reports@wordpress.org](mailto:reports@wordpress.org). Emails sent to this address will go to a private mailbox of the [WordPress Incident Response Team](https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/irt/), visible only to members of that team.

A stand-alone [Incident Reporting form](https://central.wordcamp.org/incident-report/) is also available, to make it easier for attendees and community members to report issues that come up with their local community organizers, to someone other than their local community organizers.

If the incident response squad receives a report that looks like it could be handled locally — for example, between attendees at a meetup event — a member of the global community team will get in touch with local community organizers to offer assistance.

If the report is *about* a community organizer, then we’ll reach out to the concerned parties and work to resolve the situation.

The Incident Response Team tries to respond to all reports within 72 hours of receiving the report. Resolving the issue reported may take as long as 2-3 months, depending on the nature of the issue.
