# Meetup Venue Support Request

WordPress Community Support will cover the costs of a meetup venue if a donated venue cannot be found. If you are going to ask for WordPress Community Support to cover the costs of a meetup venue, the following conditions must be met:

*   Before registering, please send an email from Meetup.com to your Meetup members and ask if anybody knows if there are any venues available that would be available for free.
*   Your group is on the WordPress chapter account at meetup.com or has been similarly recognized as official by this team.
*   Your group is currently following the [Five Good Faith rules](https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/meetup-organizer/meetup-program-basics/#the-five-good-faith-rules).
*   You are unable to find a donated venue.
*   Your proposed new venue meets the minimum requirements for safety, adequate seating, and accessibility.

**You should avoid:**

*   Venues with political affiliations
*   Venues used for religious worship (such as a church, mosque, or synagogue)
*   Venues with religious iconography
*   Venues that engage in any form of proselytizing to organizers or attendees.

Venues must align with the [WordPress Community Code of Conduct Pledge](https://make.wordpress.org/handbook/community-code-of-conduct/#our-pledge) and maintain a policy of openness to hosting events for all, without discrimination.

If those items are all met, we ask for a 3-6 month invoice and commitment; and please ask the venue if they will offer a discount for paying for 6 months up front. Please submit the venue invoice to support@wordcamp.org. Include your meetup location, venue contact name, contact’s email address and phone number, and any special payment information. You should expect a response in about a week.
