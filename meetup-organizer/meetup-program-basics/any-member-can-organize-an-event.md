# Any Member Can Organize an Event

Under the WordPress Chapter Meetup Program, any member of the group may organize events. You can find the setting for this in Group Tools.

*   Perhaps someone wants to organize a Saturday morning WordPress coffee shop get-together that only 5 people attend, and you want to organize a more formal presentation for 80 people. Both type of events are valuable! The more people getting together and connecting to talk about WordPress, the better.
*   Restricting event organizing to only a few people would automatically limit the number and scope of events — instead, we love to see a variety of organizers and events, as this will also draw a variety of members!
*   With multiple co-organizers, the group dynamic shifts from “this is my group,” to “this is a community group, for which I am a leader.” We know this can require a shift in thinking for groups that previously allowed only one or two people to organize events. But ultimately, we want WordPress meetups to function as community groups where anyone can organize events, without gatekeepers!
*   This means that you would be responsible for focus and consistency in your own event series, but not for others; though we hope that anyone choosing to organize a meetup event would talk with other organizers and learn from their experiences.

**That’s about it!** Oh, and follow [the Five Good Faith Rules](#five-good-faith-rules) mentioned at the beginning. If you have a problem with one of them, talk to us about it. You can email support@wordpress.org or find us in the Make WordPress Slack channel.  
When you become a co-organizer of a Meetup, you will receive a Meetup Organizer badge. To request a badge, please refer to the [Community Profile Badges page](https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/community-deputy/resources-and-tools/community-profile-badges/).
