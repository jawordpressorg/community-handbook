# Representing WordPress

Anyone involved in your meetup in an official role, including you, is representing WordPress. Because of this, it’s important that you vet each person/company that wants to be an organizer, speaker, or sponsor, to make sure they meet the requirements for promotion by WordPress.

General things we feel strongly about:

*   WordPress users! Lately there have been quite a few people wanting to organize meetups for the publicity value, who don’t even use WordPress to power their own blogs/sites. If you’re looking to stand up and be a WordPress community leader, you need to be  a WordPress user. It seems silly to have to state that explicitly, but there you have it.
*   No discrimination on the basis of economic or social status, race, color, ethnic origin, national origin, creed, religion, political belief, sex, sexual orientation, marital status, age, or disability. They shouldn’t engage in discriminatory practices, and you shouldn’t discriminate against anyone.
*   No incitement to violence, or promotion of hate on our watch, please.
*   No spammers.
*   No jerks. That sounds silly, too, but it’s important. If someone is in an official role and winds up alienating a chunk of your local WordPress community, that hurts WordPress as a whole. Anyone in an official role should behave appropriately.

If WordPress-based, there are a few additional requirements:

*   Respect the [WordPress trademark](http://wordpressfoundation.org/trademark-policy/). Any person or business currently misusing or infringing on the WordPress trademark will need to fix any misuse before they will be allowed to take on a sanctioned role in a meetup.
*   Embrace the [WordPress license](https://wordpress.org/about/license/). *If distributing WordPress-derivative works* (themes, plugins, WP distros), any person or business should give their users the same freedoms that WordPress itself provides. Note: this is one step above simple compliance, which requires PHP code to be GPL/compatible but allows proprietary licenses for JavaScript, CSS, and images. 100% GPL or compatible is required for promotion at meetups when WordPress-derivative works are involved, the same guidelines we follow on WordPress.org.
*   Do not promote others who fail to respect the WordPress license or trademark. If a business or person does not distribute WordPress-derivative code promotes businesses or people who do, they should meet the above guidelines.

As the meetup organizer, it will be your responsibility to ensure that these expectations are met by all members of your team, speakers, and sponsors.

As the meetup organizer, if you, or any of the members of your team, speakers, and sponsors, do not meet these expectations, then that person/persons will be removed from their role in the group.

If the person removed is the main organizer of the group, then a member of the WordPress Global Community team will also email all members of the group, inviting a new organizer to step forward, at least as the initial next step.
