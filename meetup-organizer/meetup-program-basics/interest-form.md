# Apply as an Existing Meetup Group

By joining the WordPress Meetup Chapter program, local organizers no longer have to pay hundreds of dollars a year in meetup.com fees; your group will appear on the [global map of WordPress meetups](https://www.meetup.com/pro/wordpress/) and your events are shown under ‘Upcoming Events’; and groups can be more open to community participation, since the owner doesn’t have to worry about their reputation being affected by the actions of others in the group.

To request that your existing group join the WordPress Meetup Chapter Program, please use the standard [Meetup Organizer Application](https://central.wordcamp.org/meetup-organizer-application/). Write “yes” in the box asking if there is an existing group, and provide the URL.

### When an existing meetup.com group joins the WordPress Meetup Chapter Program, you can expect the following:

#### **What changes**

*   WordPress Community Support, PBC takes over payment of meetup.com dues and will be listed as the primary group organizer. The original group organizer is listed as Co-Organizer, as are any other existing Co-Organizers.
*   All event organizing and communications will continue to come from the local organizers — not from WordPress.
*   You agree to
    *   [Follow the Five Good Faith Rules](https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/meetup-organizer/meetup-program-basics/#five-good-faith-rules).
    *   [Uphold the GPL](https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/meetup-organizer/meetup-program-basics/#upholding-the-gpl).
    *   [Allow any responsible member of the meetup to organize events for the meetup](https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/meetup-organizer/meetup-program-basics/any-member-can-organize-an-event/).

#### **What stays the same**

*   Organizers retain access to the group tools on meetup.com.
*   The group name and URL remain the same.
*   The design of your site is unchanged unless you are using the wrong logo (a [fauxgo](https://wordpress.org/about/logos/)) or misspelling WordPress, in which case we’d ask you to fix that.
*   Organizers will be included in a monthly communication that connects them to the WordPress project and to other meetup organizers (how much or little you choose to get involved is up to you).

#### **Additional benefits of joining the WordPress Meetup Chapter Program**

*   Videos of presentations (or other recorded sessions) from your meetup group will have streamlined access to publication on WordPress.tv.
*   We’ll send you WordPress swag (stickers and pins) to share with your members. Email support@wordcamp.org to request some!
*   You can request support from WordPress Community Support to cover costs such as venue rentals when donated space can’t be found; and WordPress Community Support can help meetup organizers access other resources that make it easier to organize events. [More information here](https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/meetup-organizer/getting-started/venue-approval/).

#### **What we’ll ask of you**

*   If you currently require people to submit an application to join your group, we ask that you remove that requirement. WordPress meetup groups are open to all who are interested. You can still ask those questions on the regular “join this meetup” form.
*   Each year, WordPress Community Support will send a survey to all meetup members around the world to gather feedback. We’ll share the results with meetup organizers, so that we can continually work together to strengthen the global WordPress meetup program.
