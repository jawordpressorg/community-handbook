# What Does it Take to be an Organizer?

Since all event planning and organizing is done locally, Meetup organizers are reliable people who love WordPress and want to foster a local community in their area. If you have spoken with other people who are involved in technology in your town, you probably have some understanding of the level of interest people have. You may have also noticed that they all come from a lot of different backgrounds.

Being ready to create and host family-friendly, inclusive events is incredibly important to the success of your local WordPress community.

In order to create consistency in terms of people’s experiences in the WordPress community, it is important that Meetups adhere to our five good faith rules. These rules were created by a group of volunteer Meetup organizers as a means to capture the spirit of the WordPress community.

#### The Five Good Faith Rules

1.  WordPress Meetups are for the benefit of the WordPress community as a whole, not specific businesses or individuals. All actions taken as an event organizer are with the best interest of the community in mind.
2.  Membership in the local Meetup group is open to all who wish to join, regardless of ability, skill, financial status, or any other criteria.
3.  Meetups are volunteer-run with volunteer speakers.
4.  Meetup groups allow events to be organized by any reliable/trusted member of the community.
5.  Meetups are welcoming places where everyone works to foster an accepting environment that is free of discrimination, incitement to violence, promotion of hate, and general jerk-like behavior.

We also ask everyone that organizes WordPress Chapter Meetup to uphold the principles of the WordPress open source project, including the GPL. This helps protect the user/attendee, who might not realize that by using a non-GPL plugin or theme, they are giving away the rights that WordPress provides them.
