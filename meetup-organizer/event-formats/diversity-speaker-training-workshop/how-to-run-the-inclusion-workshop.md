# Hold an &#8220;Organizing Diverse and Inclusive WordPress Events&#8221; workshop

## About workshop:

This is the 2.5-hour interactive watch party online to learn how to create welcoming and diverse WordPress Meetups and WordCamps for your WordPress community that the [#WPDiversity](https://make.wordpress.org/community/tag/wpdiversity/) group has been running regularly since 2021.

This workshop is not just for organizers, but anyone who wants to champion this kind of environment at official WordPress events, now or in the future.

You are invited to hold this workshop for the global community or for your own local community!

This is designed as an “interactive watch party” workshop to view the videos with the original diverse panel of creators, with some additional, new “live” content at the start.

## How to hold the workshop:

If you read nothing else on this page, do this:

Load up the [Main Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1i6rlCPO1x0P7QMWUKy5vXvNi9CHL5nRfmkzVlMsidQM/edit?usp=sharing)

It will lead you through all of the parts.

## Alternate – Very Easy Way to Run Workshop:

*   1\. Do the first 8 [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1i6rlCPO1x0P7QMWUKy5vXvNi9CHL5nRfmkzVlMsidQM/edit?usp=sharing), up to slide #9 “**Why do we care about diversity in WordPress?**“

For the rest of the time, hit play on the video(s):

*   2\. [Diversity in WordPress: Why and what is it in your part of the world?](https://wordpress.tv/2023/08/13/jill-binder-diversity-in-wordpress-why-and-what-is-it-in-your-part-of-the-world/)

## Additional notes and assets, if needed: 

It is recommended to run this workshop as a mixture of live parts (first 2 modules) and video watch party (the other 5 modules). The [Main Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1i6rlCPO1x0P7QMWUKy5vXvNi9CHL5nRfmkzVlMsidQM/edit?usp=sharing) walk you through this.

### However, if you want to run more of the workshop “live” (reduced videos — not recommended):

If you are doing any part of the videos live, please heed these important notes:

*   The creators of this workshop (the people in the videos – Aurooba, Allie, David) have agreed that we can use the content as long as we don’t tell their own stories for them. You can either play their story in the video or you can replace it with your own relevant story.
    *   Stories to play or replace in video 1:
        *   Mindset: Aurooba’s story @ 6:03-7:23
        *   Mindset: David’s story @ 13:03 – 15:48
        *   Community: Allie’s story @ 18:18-19:39
        *   Speakers: Jill’s story @ 29:07-31:11
        *   Speakers: Jill’s story @ 34:27-35:02
        *   Space: David’s story @ 40:52-43:46
    *   Story to play or replace in video 2:
        *   Allie’s story @ 1:13-1:42

*   This workshop is full of personal examples interwoven throughout. You may optionally replace any with your own examples, especially your own and/or local examples that would be useful for your group to know.
