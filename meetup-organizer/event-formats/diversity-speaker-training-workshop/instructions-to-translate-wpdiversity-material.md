## Translating Video Subtitles

First, you need English subtitles. If there is already an English transcript, ask on the WordPress Slack channel [#training](https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C02RW657Q) for help with uploading them to WordPress.tv.

If you don’t have the English subtitles / transcript yet, for WordPress diversity material, reach out to @katiejrichards on the WordPress Slack to create it.

Once you have the English subtitles / transcript, refer to the [Translating Subtitles](https://make.wordpress.org/training/handbook/training-team-how-to-guides/content-localization/translating-subtitles/) instruction page on the Training Team Handbook for how to translate them to another language.
