### **Program 1: Diverse Speaker Workshops**

We hold interactive speaker workshops for people from underrepresented groups in WordPress that bust through people’s obstacles to public speaking. Participants report a 30% increase in public speaking confidence. 

Our material covers:

*   The Myths of Being a speaker (aka Impostor Syndrome)
*   Finding a Topic
*   Writing the Pitch
*   Creating Your Presentation
*   Becoming a Better Speaker
*   Creating Great Slides

We hold both live workshops and watch parties in real-time for people from underrepresented groups.

[Pre-recorded workshops](https://learn.wordpress.org/?s=diverse) are available to everyone on Learn WordPress.

Closed group sessions help workshop participants open up about vulnerable challenges, and it gives people immediate feedback on their topics, pitches, and outlines. Both of these are key to helping people overcome Impostor Syndrome.

Benefits include:

*   300% increase in speaker applications from underrepresented groups.
*   500% increase in speakers from underrepresented groups.
*   More dynamic and interesting events and communities; when people see themselves represented on the speaker lineup, they want to come to your events!

> “Before taking the workshops, I didn’t have the confidence for public speaking. Thanks to these sessions, I can relax, gather my thoughts, and proceed with my presentation. I would recommend this workshop to people of color in the WordPress ecosystem. You belong here; it’s a no-judgment zone where you can find your authentic voice.”
> 
> *– TC, Learner Advocate, @codebrother1, USA*

> “The Diversity Speaker training workshops we ran at local meetups using this material were highly successful and helped us achieve an unprecedented 60% of women speakers that year. I highly recommend it to anyone who is conscientious of encouraging more women and other diverse groups to speak at WordPress events.”
> 
> *– Nichole Betterley, 2017 WordCamp Seattle Speaker Wrangler*

#### **Questions and Answers:**

**Question:** “I have a meetup or WordCamp coming up and would love to have this workshop for my community. Can we do this?”

**Answer:** Yes! We would be happy to hold a workshop to help you get more diverse speakers for YOUR upcoming WordCamp. Or you can hold one yourself, and we’ll show you how. Reach out to the [#diverse-speaker-support](https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C028SE81N3H) Slack channel.

**Question:** “But there are no people from underrepresented groups in my community!”

**Answer:** Time and again, we see people who have never attended an event before participate in this workshop and then start participating in the community.

**Question:** “I’m an organizer and I want to take this workshop myself. Can I?”

**Answer:** Most of our workshops are open to organizers as well. You can also watch one of [videos online](https://learn.wordpress.org/lesson-plan/speaker-training-workshop/). They help you to get to know our work better, and they’re also one of the best ways to learn how to hold the workshop yourself.

### **Program 2: Diverse Speaker Support Slack Group**

We want to help community members get on stage (or screen) more quickly.

The [#diverse-speaker-support](https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C028SE81N3H) Slack Channel offers a supportive space where speakers from underrepresented groups, WordPress event organizers, and speaker mentors can build community and workshop their talk ideas, pitches, and outlines. This Slack channel is for:

*   Underrepresented speakers looking for opportunities
*   Event organizers looking for speakers
*   Experienced speakers looking to share feedback and mentor others
*   Anyone who wants to support DEI in WordPress  
    

> “I truly appreciate the existence of the Diverse Speaker group. Definitely wouldn’t have done a successful talk at WordCamp US without it. I guess I can’t say that I suck at public speaking anymore!”
> 
> *– Ebonie Butler, Senior Software Engineer, Philadelphia USA*

### **Program 3: Organizing Diverse & Inclusive WordPress Events**

This workshop helps WordPress event organizers and contributors produce diverse, inclusive, and welcoming events. Past participants reported a 52% increase in preparedness to hold an inclusive event.

This is not only for event organizers; anyone who wants to champion a better WordPress community can attend.

We cover 5 topics:

1.  Mindset shift
2.  Community
3.  Environment
4.  Speakers and Leaders
5.  Allyship

A month after the workshop, we hold a follow-up discussion on Slack for your questions and challenges.

You are always invited back to the workshop and Slack chats. This is ongoing work.

> “I loved taking the “Organizing Diverse & Inclusive WordPress Events” workshop along with other organizers and hearing what they’ve done. The checklists in the workbook are helpful in terms of tracking what I have done and what I can still improve. I’d love to see ALL THE ORGANIZERS go through this. This felt like a great complement to other material that WordPress has about not disparaging people; the focus of the Inclusion workshop was on how to be actively welcoming.”
> 
> *– Sallie Goetsch, organizer, East Bay WordPress Meetup*

There are many opportunities to help out from big roles to occasional help.

**You’re a good fit if:** You have a desire to bring more diversity to WordPress events around the world, and you want to help shape how that happens. No prior experience necessary, but a willingness to share ideas, collaborate, and help define and tackle tasks would be amazing.
