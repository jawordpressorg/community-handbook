# Hold an Underrepresented Speaker Workshop

Hold An Underrepresented Speaker workshop (aka “How to Own Your Expertise and Start Speaking at WordPress Events”)

## About Workshop:

The flagship, proven effective workshop of the [#WPDiversity](https://make.wordpress.org/community/tag/wpdiversity/) group. This workshop is a “bridge” for underrepresented voices in WordPress go from, “I would never consider speaking at a WordPress event” or “I don’t know what to talk about” to being eager to start speaking.

The core material in both versions of the workshop covers:

*   Overcoming personal obstacles to speaking
*   Finding a topic that the community will be excited to hear

The “full” version goes on to help the speakers develop their talk, speaker kit, and stage presence. You can pick and choose to run any module or all 5.
