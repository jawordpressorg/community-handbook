# State of the Word Watch Parties

State of the Word is an annual keynote delivered by Matt Mullenweg, co-founder of the WordPress project. This event provides key updates about the WordPress project and community, highlights from the past year, and a look ahead at how the project will grow in the coming year. It is streamed online for those who can’t attend in person.

If you can’t attend in person, consider hosting a watch party with your local community. Below are tips and resources to help you organize a fun and engaging event as we reflect on the past year and look forward to the future of WordPress.

## Why Organizing a State of the Word Watch Party?

1.  Your meetup group members might not know the State of the Word or its impact on them. Hosting a watch party gives them a chance to experience it firsthand.
2.  A watch party is an inclusive and fun way to wrap up the year, reconnect, and celebrate with your WordPress community.

## Organizing an In-person Watch Party

**1\. Find a Venue**

**You don’t need a fancy venue for the watch party!** All you need is a place that has:

*   Enough room for your community, preferably wheelchair accessible
*   A screen large enough for YouTube streaming
*   A decent audio system
*   A reliable internet connection for smooth HD video playback

This could even be a community member’s home or office. Prioritize finding a free venue, but if that’s challenging, explore securing a donated space through sponsors or submit a [Meetup Venue Support Request](https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/meetup-organizer/meetup-program-basics/venue-approval/) to cover the cost of a paid venue (you don’t need a 3-6 month invoice and commitment, as this is a special event).

To find additional suggestions for searching for venues, refer to the [FAQ page](https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/meetup-organizer/getting-started/#where-should-we-hold-our-meetup).

**2\. Create Meetup.com Event**

You can [use a Meetup.com Template to Schedule a State of the Word Watch Party](https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/meetup-organizer/state-of-the-word-watch-parties/using-a-meetup-com-template-to-schedule-a-state-of-the-word-watch-party/).

**3\. On The Event Day**

If your group is meeting at an unusual location, post clear directions and maybe even put out some signs to make it easy to find the party.

Try playing a video before the event ([such as previous years’ State of the Word recordings](https://wordpress.tv/tag/state-of-the-word/)) to see if the video is playing well and if the audio is clear.

## Organizing an Online Watch Party

Here are two ways to organize an online watch party. **The difference is the link you share with your meetup group.** Both are good options. Pick what’s right for you!

### Option 1: Use the State of the Word Streaming Link

1.  Schedule an online event for your Meetup.com group; you can use [the template](https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/meetup-organizer/state-of-the-word-watch-parties/using-a-meetup-com-template-to-schedule-a-state-of-the-word-watch-party/) if you’d like.
2.  Add the State of the Word YouTube streaming link, which will become available on the [State of the Word landing page](https://wordpress.org/state-of-the-word/).
3.  If you’d like to chat with your group, create/pick a space on a third-party application such as Slack, Discord, or a WhatsApp/Telegram group. Include that link in the invitation.

### Option 2: Use a Zoom or Google Meet Link and Screen Sharing

1.  Schedule an online event for your Meetup.com group; you can use [the template](https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/meetup-organizer/state-of-the-word-watch-parties/using-a-meetup-com-template-to-schedule-a-state-of-the-word-watch-party/) if you’d like.
2.  Add a Zoom or Google Meet link that is exclusive to your group.
3.  The host will broadcast the Livestream to the attendees using screen sharing.
4.  Meetup attendees can interact with each other over video, audio, and chat as they listen to State of the Word. 

There are also a few other ways to host a watch party as well, using Chrome Extensions and third-party tools, too.

## Tips for a Successful Watch Party

*   **Plan a short, post-event retrospective** where attendees can discuss the contents of State of the Word and what they learned.
*   **Plan some fun activities**. After the event, how about a pop quiz on WordPress trivia?
*   **Share on social media.** Post your pictures, videos, takeaways, and observations using the hashtag: `#StateOfTheWord` and `#WordPress`.

### Streaming Tips

*   Test screen and audio sharing using your video tool, along with playing back a YouTube video before the event. Enlist some attendees to check if the audio is clear.
*   Ensure that captions are enabled on YouTube.
*   Ask attendees to restrict their interactions to chat within the video-sharing tool. If attendees speak as the stream is playing, it might make it difficult for other participants to follow.
*   Encourage everyone to keep their mics muted as the stream plays.
