# Email Templates for the State of the Word

Here are some free-to-use templates for emailing your meetup group members about upcoming State of the Word events.

If you are not organizing a watch party, we ask that you send a general invitation email to your group members announcing the event. This allows those who may not be aware of the event to participate as they choose. 

Before you start:

*   Check the templates for any updates you need to make, such as **\[CITY-NAME\]** **\[DATE\]** or **\[YEAR\]**, etc.
*   Having snacks? Not having snacks? Make sure to adjust that information as needed in the In-person template.
*   You are welcome to make other adjustments to these templates to fit your event and community. These are guides to help you get started and make the process easier.
