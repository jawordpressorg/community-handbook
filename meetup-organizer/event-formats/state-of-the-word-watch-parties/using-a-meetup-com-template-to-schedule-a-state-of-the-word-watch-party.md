# Using a Meetup.com Template to Schedule a State of the Word Watch Party

We have made scheduling a [State of the Word Watch Party](https://href.li/?https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/meetup-organizer/event-formats/state-of-the-word-watch-parties/#top) much easier by creating dedicated templates on Meetup.com. 

1.  Go to your Meetup.com page and click on the red **Create Event** button, followed by the **Create New Event** button from the dropdown.  
      
    ![Create new event](https://make.wordpress.org/community/files/2021/11/Create-new-event.png)  
    
2.  On the right-hand sidebar at the top, choose the option: **Start from a template**.  
      
    ![Start from Template](https://make.wordpress.org/community/files/2021/11/Start-from-Template.png)  
    
3.  You will now see two templates—one each for the in-person and online events. Depending on the meetup format you are organizing, pick the template that is applicable to you—in-person or online.  
      
    ![Choose the template](https://make.wordpress.org/community/files/2021/11/Choose-the-template.png)  
    
4.  The event details will now appear in the event description. **Make sure you fill in the date and time placeholders.**  
      
    **Note:** If your State of the Word is happening at an odd hour in your timezone, plan your event at a different, more convenient time and enjoy watching the replay of the State of the Word stream together.  
    
5.  Add a featured image.  
    
6.  Publish the event!
