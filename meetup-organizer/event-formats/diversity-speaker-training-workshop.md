# Diverse Speaker Training Group (#WPDiversity)

The Diverse Speaker Training group has been in existence since late 2017. As of mid-2021, the working group expanded the offerings for Meetup and WordCamp organizers to include:

## Program 1: Diverse Speaker Workshops

Have you ever had trouble getting people from marginalized and underrepresented groups (in terms of gender, race, class, sexuality, ability, age, etc.) to speak at your meetups and WordCamps?

Our group holds interactive, hands-on, transformational Diverse Speaker workshops for people from underrepresented groups in WordPress. The workshops bust through people’s obstacles to public speaking. Our workshop participants report a 20% increase in public speaking confidence. Our material covers:

*   The Myths of Being a speaker (aka Impostor Syndrome)
*   Finding a Topic for a WordPress Talk
*   Writing the Pitch for your WordPress Talk
*   Creating Your WordPress Talk
*   Becoming a Better Speaker
*   Creating Great Slides

We hold both live workshops and watch parties in real-time for people from underrepresented groups and pre-recorded workshops are available to everyone on learn.wordpress.org ([Part 1](https://learn.wordpress.org/workshop/diverse-speaker-training-workshop-part-1/), [Part 2](https://learn.wordpress.org/workshop/diverse-speaker-training-workshop-part-2/), [Part 3](https://learn.wordpress.org/workshop/diverse-speaker-training-workshop-part-3/), [Part 4](https://learn.wordpress.org/workshop/diverse-speaker-training-workshop-part-4/); [English Lesson Plan](https://learn.wordpress.org/lesson-plan/speaker-training-workshop/); [Japanese lesson plan](https://ja.wordpress.org/team/handbook/diversity-speaker-training/), [Spanish (Latin American lesson plan](https://learn.wordpress.org/lesson-plan/taller-de-formacion-de-ponentes/)), [Portuguese BR (Brazil) lesson plan](https://learn.wordpress.org/lesson-plan/treinamento-de-palestrantes/)). Closed groups help workshop participants open up about vulnerable challenges and it gives people immediate feedback on their topics, pitches, and outlines. Both of these are key to helping people overcome Impostor Syndrome.

Some of the benefits we’ve seen from communities attending or hosting these workshops include:

*   Tripling the number of speaker applications from underrepresented groups.
*   Groups who’ve started at 10% or fewer speakers from marginalized or underrepresented groups have grown to have 50% or more speaker representation.
*   More dynamic and interesting events and communities – when people see themselves represented on the speaker lineup, more people want to come to your events.

> “Before taking the workshops, I didn’t have the confidence for public speaking. Thanks to these sessions, I can relax, gather my thoughts, and proceed with my presentation. I would recommend this workshop to people of color in the WordPress ecosystem. You belong here; it’s a no-judgment zone where you can find your authentic voice.”

> “The Diversity Speaker training workshops we ran at local meetups using this material  
> were highly successful and helped us achieve an unprecedented 60% of women speakers  
> that year. I highly recommend it to anyone who is conscientious of encouraging more  
> women and other diverse groups to speak at WordPress events.”

### Questions and Answers:

**Question:** “I have a meetup or WordCamp coming up and would love to have this workshop for my community. Can we do this?”

**Answer:** Yes! We would be happy to hold a workshop to help you get more diverse speakers for YOUR upcoming WordCamp. Or you can hold one yourself — we show you how. Please fill out the form below to set either of these up.

**Question:** “But there are no people from underrepresented groups in my community!”

**Answer:** Time and again, when the event is posted properly (which you’ll learn how), we see folks who have never come out to an event before attend this workshop and then start participating in the community.

**Question:** “I’m an organizer and I want to take this workshop myself. Can I?”

**Answer:** Most of our workshops are open to organizers as well. We would love it if you yourself attended a workshop or watched our videos online. It would be great for you to get to know our work better, plus also help improve your own public speaking confidence. It is also one of the ways to learn how to hold the workshop yourself.

## Program 2: Diverse Speaker Support Slack Group

With the loss of in-person events, the road between workshop and speaking has become harder. We want to help community members get on stage more quickly — and to help WordPress event organizers develop more great speakers as soon as possible.

The [#diverse-speaker-support](https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C028SE81N3H) Slack Channel offers a forum where speakers from marginalized and underrepresented groups, WordPress event organizers, and speaker mentors can build community. This Slack channel is for:

*   Anyone from your community who takes the Diverse Speaker Training workshop.
*   Event organizers seeking speakers for diverse and inclusive events. 
*   Experienced speakers and community members who want to mentor new speakers.
    *   We ask that speaker mentors take our Inclusion workshop first.

It’s a great, supportive, safer space in which community members can workshop their talk ideas, pitches, and outlines with the group.

## Program 3: Organizing Diverse & Inclusive WordPress Events

Do you want to organize diverse, inclusive and welcoming WordPress events, but don’t know where to start or worry that you’ll ‘get it wrong’? This workshop is for you!

We train WordPress event organizers and WordPress contributors with the “Organizing Diverse & Inclusive WordPress Events” workshop. Past participants reported a 52% increase in preparedness to hold an inclusive event.

This is not only for WordPress event organizers, but for anyone who wants to champion a diverse, inclusive and welcoming WordPress community.

We cover 5 topics:

1.  Mindset shift: Shifting the way you think about diversity
2.  Community: How to attract and foster a diverse community
3.  Environment: Creating a welcoming environment, both in-person and online
4.  Speakers and Leaders: How to encourage more people from diverse backgrounds to be speakers and leaders
5.  Allyship: How to better support community members from diverse backgrounds

This program is offered in quarterly cohorts:

*   Month 1: A private, supportive, hands-on, interactive workshop over Zoom. You will walk away with an action list to start making changes right away.
*   Month 2: Public Slack coaching on [#community-events](https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C02RQC7RN) on the WordPress Slack
*   Month 3: Public Slack accountability on [#community-events](https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C02RQC7RN) on the WordPress Slack

Once you complete one quarterly cohort, you are invited to continue on in future quarters with Slack coaching and accountability. You are always welcome to take the workshop again as well.

> “I loved taking the “Organizing Diverse & Inclusive WordPress Events” workshop along with other organizers and hearing what they’ve done. The checklists in the workbook are helpful in terms of tracking what I have done and what I can still improve. I’d love to see ALL THE ORGANIZERS go through this. This felt like a great complement to other material that WordPress has about not disparaging people; the focus of the Inclusion workshop was on how to be actively welcoming.”
