# Using a Meetup.com Template to Schedule a WordPress Anniversary Celebration

We have made the process of scheduling an anniversary party a lot easier. We have dedicated templates created in Meetup.com to help you schedule an event. 

Go to your Meetup.com page and click on the red **Create Event** button followed by the **Create New Event** button from the dropdown.  
  
![Create new event](https://make.wordpress.org/community/files/2021/11/Create-new-event.png)  

On the right hand sidebar at the top, choose the option: **Start from a template**.  
  
![Start from Template](https://make.wordpress.org/community/files/2021/11/Start-from-Template.png)  

You will now see two templates – one each for the in-person and online event. Pick the template that is applicable for you — In-person or Online — depending on the meetup format you are organizing.

You will now see the event details pop up in the event description. **Make sure you fill in the date and time placeholders.**  
  
**Note:** If your anniversary party is happening at an odd hour in your timezone, plan your event at a different, more convenient time and enjoy watching the replay of the State of the Word stream together.
