*

This event is concluded. Stay tuned for WordPress 20th Anniversary Celebrations in 2023!

*

The WordPress 15th anniversary will be on May 27, 2018 ‚Äî let‚Äôs get ready to celebrate!

### Schedule a party

WordPress anniversary parties are a great way to bring local communities together, and easy to organize. Most of the work involves finding a space to gather that‚Äôs easily accessible, free (or really, really inexpensive), and safe. Here are some ideas from past anniversary parties:

*   a picnic at a public park
*   a gathering at a family-friendly pub, restaurant, mall food court, library, or community center
*   a potluck at a community member‚Äôs home

Lots of groups like to share a birthday cake with the WordPress logo on it ‚Äî there are logo files you can download on the [WordPress 15th anniversary site](https://wp15.wordpress.net/swag/). There are some other DIY anniversary decoration files on that page as well ‚Äî get creative, show off your local flair, and have fun with it!

Once you‚Äôve selected a location and a time, you can use the WordPress 15th Anniversary event template on meetup.com to schedule your event. This will help your event show up on the map displayed on wp15.wordpress.net.

After clicking the ‚ÄúSchedule‚Äù link, you should see an option to ‚ÄúSchedule from a template‚Äù:

Once you click on ‚ÄúSchedule from a template,‚Äù a pop-up should come up with two options. Select the WordPress 15th Anniversary Party Template and customize as necessary!

**Make sure the description of the event contains the term ‚Äú#wp15‚Äù somewhere**; otherwise the WP15 website won‚Äôt be able to identify it as a WP15 event. If you‚Äôve added ‚Äú#wp15‚Äù and your event still isn‚Äôt showing up on [the map](https://wp15.wordpress.net/about/) after a few hours, then please email [support@wordcamp.org](mailto:support@wordcamp.org) with the URL of the event, so that we can add it.

### Request WordPress 15th Anniversary swag

Once you‚Äôve scheduled your celebration on meetup.com, you can request your special WordPress 15th anniversary swag pack, which includes sticker sheets and party balloons.
