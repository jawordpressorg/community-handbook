# Email Templates for Anniversary Celebrations

Here are some free to use templates to make it easier for you to email your meetup group members about upcoming Anniversary Celebrations.

If you are not organizing an anniversary celebration, we ask that you send a reminder email to your group members announcing the event. This allows those who may not be aware of the upcoming anniversary to participate as they choose.Â 

Before you start:

*   Check the templates for any updates you need to make like **\[CITY-NAME\]** **\[DATE\]** or **\[YEAR\]**, etc.
*   Having snacks? Not having snacks? Make sure to adjust that information as needed in the In-person template.
*   You are welcome to make other adjustments to these templates to fit your event and community. These are guides to help you get started and make the process easier.
*   Here is the current featured image which you can download and use as needed.
