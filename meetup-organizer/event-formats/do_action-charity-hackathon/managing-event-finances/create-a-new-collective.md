# Create a New Collective

Go to [https://opencollective.com/create-account](https://opencollective.com/create-account) and create a **personal profile**.  

After your account has been created and verified your email address, sign in to create your new collective.  

Click on your username in the top right corner of the screen and select the “+ New” button next to the “My Collectives” heading:

Select “Other” for the type of collective you are creating:

Fill in your collective details using the following guides:

*   **Name:** The name of your event – e.g. “do\_action Cape Town” – *do not include the year of the event in the Collective name*.
*   **Short description:** A one-sentence description of your event – no specific text required.
*   **Website:** The URL where you are managing your event – e.g. “https://doaction.org/event/cape-town-2019/”.
*   **Tags:** Optional tags to label your event.

After collective creation, you will be taken to the collective page. Click on the “edit collective” link in the banner to add more information about your collective:

There’s a lot of information you can add at this point, so take your time to get it all in there. Remember that you can come back and edit this info at any time. Here’s a guide to the areas that are important to note:

*   **Info**  
    Fill in any extra info you like here – the *Country* and *Long description* are particularly useful but optional.
*   **Images**  
    Add an avatar (appears at the top of the banner on your collective page) and a cover image (background image for the banner) if you like.
*   **Members**  
    Add other members of your organising team who should have access to managing this collective (i.e. editing these details and submitting expenses). Add each member as a “Core Contributor” and fill in their name and email address. If they do not have an Open Collective profile then they will receive an email with a sign-up link before they can start to manage things.
*   **Goals**  
    Add your event budget as a ‘yearly goal’ – you can always change this later as you finalise your budget, so you can leave this empty for now:

*   F**iscal host**  
    Ignore this for now – you’ll add your collective to the WordPress Foundation host a little later.
*   **Tiers**  
    Set your planned sponsorship tiers – you can always return to this later once you have a better idea of your event budget. You can set this up in whatever way you feel works best for your budget and community. A flexible donation model is suggested, but you can do this in whatever way works best for your community:

*   **Expenses**  
    This is optional and probably not necessary. You can dictate an expense policy here to remind your core contributors what kind of expenses they can submit.
*   **Connected Accounts**  
    Feel free to connect your collective to a community Twitter account to automatically thank people who donate money.
*   **Advanced**  
    You can set a new URL slug for your collective if you like (it will default to auto-creating a slug from your event name). You can also switch on markdown support if you would like that to be available in the text editors on the site for you.
