# Join the WPF Host

Once you have created your collective, you will need to add your collective to the WordPress Foundation (WPF) ‘host’ collective. This will allow the WPF to be you fiscal host meaning that all of the financial transactions for your collective will be run through the WPF bank account.

To start, go to [the WPF host collective page here](https://opencollective.com/wpf) (you can also search for the WPF on the [hosts page](https://opencollective.com/hosts)).

Click on the blue “Apply to host your collective…” button in the page header:

You will get a message that says “application pending”. Wait for approval to join the WPF host – you can ask in the [#community-events](https://make.wordpress.org/community/tag/community-events/) channel in Slack to speed up this approval process.

And that’s it – next step is [creating an event within your collective](https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/meetup-organizer/event-formats/do_action-charity-hackathon/managing-event-finances/create-an-event/).
