# Submit Invoices

> Do not submit vendor invoices directly through Open Collective. These events require organisers to pay up front and then request reimbursement via Open Collective. Payments are made via PayPal, so please provide a PayPal address in order to receive funds.

In the top right-hand corner of your Open Collective account, click on the arrow by your profile name to reveal your collectives. Click on the collective you would like to submit an invoice for:

The masthead or header art located across the top of your page is part of the look and feel of your website. It can influence a visitor’s opinion about your content and you/ your organization’s brand. It may also look different on different screen sizes.:
