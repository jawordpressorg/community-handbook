# Submit Invoices

> Do not submit vendor invoices directly through Open Collective. These events require organisers to pay up front and then request reimbursement via Open Collective. Payments are made via PayPal, so please provide a PayPal address in order to receive funds.

In the top right-hand corner of your Open Collective account, click on the arrow by your profile name to reveal your collectives. Click on the collective you would like to submit an invoice for:

This will open up a new section where you will be required to fill in the requested information including uploading your invoice or receipt, and your payout method. Please select the appropriate payout method for yourself or the vendor as well as include any special instructions for payment that are needed.
