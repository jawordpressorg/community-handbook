# Create an Event

After you have successfully created your collective, now this is the time you can create an event under your collective.  

Click the  ‘Create an Event’ link under the Events heading on your collective page:

This will take you to the event creation form:

*   Since this is your first event, you cannot choose a previous template to build event, so ignore this for the moment.
*   Name your Event as event + city name + year – e.g. “do\_action Karachi 2019”.
*   Give a short description of your event
*   Give a long description of the event with as much detail as possible
*   Give start date/time & end date/time of your event
*   Add the event venue
*   **Skip the ‘Tickets’ section since WPF events are free to attend.**
*   Optionally add descriptive tags to the event. This would help the event show up better in search results.
*   Click the “Create Event” button and you’re done!

Once your collective and event have been created, you will need to [set a budget for your event](https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/meetup-organizer/event-formats/do_action-charity-hackathon/set-event-budget/) so that you have a public goal to work towards.
