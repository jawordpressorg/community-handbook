# Set Event Budget

In the right hand corner of your open collective account, click on the arrow by your profile name to reveal your collectives. Click on the collective you would like to set a budget for. In this case, that would be the city do\_action collective you created earlier.

This will open another page where you will see some options (info, images, members, goals, fiscal host, etc), click on the ‘Goals’ link. This will open up a section for you to add your goal:

Fill in the required information:

*   **Type**: This must be ‘yearly budget’.
*   **Amount**: This will be the total (or estimated) budget for your event.
*   **Title**: This will be the name and year of your event (e.g “do\_action Lagos 2019”)
*   **Description**: This is optional and can be used for explaining just what costs you are including in the budget.

Click ‘save’ when you are done.

Now that your event budget is published you can start looking for sponsor and [submitting invoices for vendor payments](https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/meetup-organizer/event-formats/do_action-charity-hackathon/managing-event-finances/submit-invoices/).
