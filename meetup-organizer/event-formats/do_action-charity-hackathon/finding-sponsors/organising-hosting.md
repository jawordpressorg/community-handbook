# Organising Hosting

Sponsors for the day are important, but one thing that we have not yet touched on is the fact that you will need to find sponsored hosting for the new non-profits websites. This is important as it allows the organisations the freedom to continue working with their new websites without further costs being involved.

How this works will very much depend on the country that you live in, but a good idea is to contact a local hosting company and discuss the options with them. Once again, make sure the potential host is aware that this is a charity event – in many cases, hosts have free hosting plans for registered non-profit organisations and will be happy to come on board for your event.

Some of your non-profits may already have hosting that they wish to continue using – that isn’t a problem at all and they are welcome to do so. In those instance you will need to get hold of the relevant connection details (FTP, etc.) in order to set up their new website.

## A few country-specific options

There are a few countries where do\_action events have been run before, so we are aware of free hosting options for registered non-profits. To that end, here is some handy information for those countries – if you organise a do\_action event in your area and you become aware of a good hosting option for do\_action events then [let us know](mailto:support@wordcamp.org) and we can add the info to this page.

### South Africa

In South Africa, local hosting provider, [xneelo](https://xneelo.co.za/), are happy to provide sponsored hosting for registered non-profit organisations. You can contact them directly and they will help you with sorting things out.
