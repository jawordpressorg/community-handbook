# Google Workspace account for do_action events

Starting March 2021, once you are approved as a do\_action event organizer, we will set up a Google Workspace email account ([formerly known](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/workspace/introducing-google-workspace) as G Suite) for your event in the format of city@doaction.org. Past organizers often asked if they could have doaction.org email addresses so that they would look more official when contacting venues, sponsors, etc, and hence we will provide one shared Google Workspace account for the organizing team of a do\_action event, just like how we provide dedicated email ids to WordCamps. 

Along with Gmail, the Google Workspace account we provide you will have the following tools enabled: Calendar, Drive and Docs, Google Meet, Groups for Business, Tasks, YouTube, Maps, and Keep.

Sometimes, sharing credentials of an inbox with members of a large organizing team could get tricky. If you would like to share the doaction.org email account with multiple organizers, you can consider using a shared inbox tool. Upon request, we can set up a [Google Group](https://support.google.com/a/answer/167430?hl=en) (with the Google Groups for Business feature set) for your team. You could also set up third-party tools such as [FreeScout](https://github.com/freescout-helpdesk/freescout/wiki/Fetching-Emails#g-suite) or HelpScout to manage emails as a team.

You can use your Google Workspace email account to send/receive emails. It works just like a regular Gmail inbox with all the features. Read on to find out more about the G Suite account, and on how you can use it for your event.

### Setting up a Google Workspace Account for your do\_action event

Community Deputies will provide organizers with the credentials for the Google Workspace account over email (after a successful do\_action orientation). They can use those credentials to sign in to the Google account by visiting: [https://accounts.google.com/](https://accounts.google.com/) or [https://mail.google.com/a/doaction.org](https://mail.google.com/a/doaction.org) to access their emails. We recommend that you set up a recovery email and a phone number for account security. If you want, you can also set up Two Factor Authentication (2FA) for your account to bolster account security; however, this will make it difficult for sharing credentials between organizers. If you do set up two-factor authentication, and wish to share credentials with your organizing team, you can use options like [security keys](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6103523), or a Two Factor software such as Authy (which provides accounts) for sharing [two-factor authentication credentials](https://authy.com/guides/googleandgmail/). 

By activating your Google Workspace account, you automatically get access to all the Google Workspace tools listed above.
