# Booking a Venue

When looking for a potential do\_action venue, you need to look for a few things that will help make your event more effective. These are a few of the things to consider:

*   A space with enough desks for each of your build teams – a team could have up to 10 people depending on the needs of the non-profit and how many representatives from the organisation attend on the day.
*   A decent area for participants to take breaks away from their screens as well as eat their meals.
*   An area where you can gather everyone together for delivering information as well as hosting the end of day presentations.
*   A private room where you can train the non-profits on how to use WordPress.

You may have already worked this out, but the best type of venue for this kind of event is a co-working space. They usually have plenty of desks (that can often be moved around to accommodate your needs), a well-positioned break area, a private board room, and a projector in an accessible location.

Once you have identified a few eligible venues in your area, then get out there and have a look at them. Once you have identified the best options then chat to them about available dates and secure a date that works well for.

**When chatting to the venue about pricing, make sure they are aware that this is a charity event. In many cases they will offer you heavily discounted rates and sometimes even offer you the venue for free.** Given the nature of this event, these kinds of discounts are hugely beneficial and will reduce the already low costs for this event even further.

## A note about event dates

When securing a date with your venue, it’s best to give yourself at least 2-3 months lead time before the actual event. The more you can have the better as this will allow you ample time to plan your event, as well as have participant sign-ups open for a decent amount of time.
