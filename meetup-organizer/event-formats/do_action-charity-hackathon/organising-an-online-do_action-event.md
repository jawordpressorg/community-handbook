# Organising an Online do_action Event

> We strongly encourage in-person do\_action events, but in the current time of crisis we are making allowances and suggestions for online events until things have returned to normal again.

If you are organising an online/virtual do\_action event, you can do things a little differently to an in-person event. Here are some suggestions of things you can change if you wish to do so:

1.  **Organise a country-wide do\_action event.** Since these events are going to be virtual, it makes sense to bring in talents from the whole country, as well as reach more non-profit organisations that would otherwise be possible.
2.  **Spread the work out over a few days/weeks.** In order to give people the time to work on the websites for the non-profit organisations, allow them to work over a longer time period than just one day. A format I quite like the idea of is giving each team 1 week to complete their work.
3.  **Provide virtual communication channels.** Use your local WordPress community Slack group (or create one if you donâ€™t have one already) and set up separate channels for each team to communicate. You could also use some of [the tools we suggest for meetups](https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/meetup-organizer/resources/organizing-virtual-events/) to expand on the communication options.
