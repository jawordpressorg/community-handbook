# Managing Event Finances

In order to facilitate financial transaction for WordPress Foundation events (like do\_action) we are using [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/) as a financial management platform.

Open Collective allows organisations (known as ‘collectives’) to publish their budgets, collect sponsorship payments, and pay vendors all from a simple and transparent UI. For the purposes of these events, we are going to be naming each Collective as the event type & city (e.g. “do\_action Cape Town”) with each specific event inside the collective for each year it runs (e.g. “do\_action Cape Town 2019”). Each collective will then be under the WordPress Foundation “host collective”, which will allow all financial transactions to go through the Foundation bank account.

If that all sounds a little confusing, then don’t worry – just follow the docs here to get it all set up correctly. To start off, you need to [create a new collective](https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/meetup-organizer/event-formats/do_action-charity-hackathon/managing-event-finances/create-a-new-collective/).
