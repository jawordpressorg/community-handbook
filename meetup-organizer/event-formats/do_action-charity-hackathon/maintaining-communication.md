# Maintaining Communication

When your participants sign up for the event, they will immediately receive a confirmation email and they will be able to find all of the relevant info from the event page itself. This is great and it takes a lot of the manual administration off your shoulders, but even so, it is still a good idea to keep in occasional contact with your non-profits and your participants in the weeks leading up to the event – especially in the final week(s) before the event takes place.

When participants sign up they will provide their email address, allowing you to send them any additional info they need. If they already have all the required information from the event page, then it’s good to email them all the week of the event to finalise everything and remind them of the necessary information.

The amount that you communicate with your participants is up to you, so stick with what you are comfortable with, bearing in mind that it’s nice for them to receive more personal communications from time to time.

If you go to the **do\_action Tools** page in the doaction.org dashboard (once you are logged in as an organiser), then you will find a handy form that will allow you to email everyone who will be taking part in your event. You can filter the recipients by role and non-profit, so it’s very flexible and will allow you to keep in touch with people as much as you need.
