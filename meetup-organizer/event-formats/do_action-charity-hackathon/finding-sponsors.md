# Finding Sponsors

Now that you have got this far in planning your do\_action hackathon, you will notice that the costs for this kind of event are actually relatively low. In fact, the only real costs are for the venue hire and the catering – both of which can often be reduced due to this being a charity event.

When it comes to finding sponsors for your event, it’s best to go with local companies as they know your community the best and can get involved in more practical ways. That being said, the criteria for do\_action sponsorship are the same as for WordCampWordCamp WordCamps are casual, locally-organized conferences covering everything related to WordPress. They're one of the places where the WordPress community comes together to teach one another what they’ve learned throughout the year and share the joy.

In return for sponsoring the event, you can offer sponsors anything that makes sense for this kind of thing. Some suggestions are:

*   Displaying their logo, link and company description on the event page.
*   Publicly thanking them on social media.
*   Openly thanking them at the event itself.
*   A chance to give away their swag at the event to the participants.
*   Their logo projected on the screen for the day.

This is all up to you to work what makes the most sense for your event and your sponsors. In general, however, sponsors are often happy to be involved in a charity event like this with very little return on their investment.
