# Publishing your Event

Once you have your venue & date secured then you are ready to publish your event info on [the doaction.org site](http://doaction.org/). The advantage to publishing on the site is that a large amount of the manual admin work for the event is taken off your shoulders. Specifically, the site handles the following for you:

*   Accepting applications from non-profits
*   Accepting sign-ups from participants (once you have finalised your non-profits)
*   Supplying people with all the info they need (including a map to the venue)
*   Publicly thanking your sponsors
*   Generally getting the word out about your event

In order to add your event to the site you need to be added as an organiser – **to apply as an organiser please fill in [the application form here](https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/meetup-organizer/event-formats/do_action-charity-hackathon/do_action-event-application/)**.

Once you have been added to the site as an organiser, you will be able to add your event along with all of the relevant details (date, venue and address) in pre-defined meta fields. You will also be able to add all of the non-profits that you will be working with on the day – however, if you allow the non-profits to sign up via this site (as outlined on the next page of this handbook) then they will already be saved as drafts for you to activate.

The URL for your event will look something like this: `http://doaction.org/event/event-slug` – you can use this page to promote your event and accept participant sign-ups.
