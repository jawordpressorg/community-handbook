# Event Formats

Sometimes getting started organizing an event can be a little overwhelming. It does not have to be though. Not every Meetup event needs to be a formal lecture with questions and answers in a rented venue. Meetup events can be as formal or informal as you want them to be. Having a variety of event types can help communities create the kind of group that really makes connections among WordPress enthusiasts.

Any activity that helps people connect and inspire each other to do more with WordPress is a Meetup activity. Here are some examples of events that don’t follow the typical “sit around and listen to a speaker” format:

*   **Networking or Social event** – Events like these can take the smallest amount of planning. It just takes a time and a place that hold the number of people that will attend. Coffee shops, co-working spaces, or a cool donated office could all do the trick. If you decide to meet at a restaurant or coffee shop, it is a good idea to contact the venue if you expect more than 15 people.
*   **Show and Tell** – This is a discussion of a member’s current website or project. You need a projector and screen, a room with chairs and/or tables, and a willing volunteer. The group member shows their project and describe what problems they have run into. The group can discuss possible solutions, highlight great points in the design, or just learn from each other.
*   [**Diverse Speaker Workshop**](https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/meetup-organizer/event-formats/diversity-speaker-training-workshop/) – You can run this workshop to encourage and train people from under-represented groups in your community to speak at your meetups and WordCamp.
*   **Charity Hackathon** – We have a pre-built format for charity hackathons named *do\_action*, as well as [an extensive handbook](https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/meetup-organizer/event-formats/do_action-charity-hackathon/) for how to organise an event like this.
*   **Coworking/Workalong** – Sometimes the best way to stay motivated on a personal project is to have people to talk to when you get stuck. To host a Workalong, you will need power outlets, wifi, tables and chairs, and a space that can hold the number of people that will join you. Then, work alongside your peers while you bounce ideas off one another.
*   **Coffee and Code** – This easy event can be done in a coffee shop or any space where you can get coffee and they will let you use their wifi. People can code new projects, ask questions on code they’ve forked, or learn about making their first commit. Codecademy learners would probably love an event like this.
*   **Brown Bag Sessions** – This one is a cross between a lecture and a lunch date. You will need a room where you can view a video from wordpress.tv and chairs for people to sit on. Everyone brings their lunch, watches a video, and then discusses the topic afterward.
*   **Workshops** – For this you will need someone who is comfortable walking through a project in front of a crowd. It can also be helpful to have a few people who are knowledgeable to help out if needed. You should have access to power outlets, wifi, a projector/screen, and perhaps some sort of microphone if available.
*   **Grouped Lightning Talk** – Pick a theme and instead of doing one long talk about it, have a number of lightning talks. This will help highlighting more community members, that might be reluctant to do a long talk. Ideas: WordPress plugins, productivity tools, business tools, etc.

This is just a short list. The possibilities are endless. And do not forget that any event that gets WordPress enthusiasts together and inspiring each other to do more with WordPress can be a Meetup event.
