## What are Meetups?

Meetups are locally-organized groups that meet for events on a regular basis (commonly once a month) and power year-round WordPress communities. They are a vital part of the overall WordPress open source project.

These events are intended to be relaxed, open to all, and can take many formats:

*   presentations/lecture series,
*   hackathons,
*   social gatherings,
*   workshops,
*   co-working,
*   running a WordPress help desk,
*   contributor sprints/drives, and others.

However, anything that brings together 2 or more people to share their WordPress experiences counts — there’s no minimum number of attendees or required format. Regardless of whether you want to learn about WordPress or meet others who work with it, Meetup events are a way to build a strong WordPress community in your local area.

As WordPress Meetups are organized and run by local communities, anyone can show leadership and no single person is necessarily the owner of what may be organized or hosted. WordPress Meetups are groups in which anyone is welcome to organize an event.

## The WordPress Chapter Meetup Program

WordPress has a Meetup account that is used to create the **WordPress Chapter Meetup Program**. WordPress meetup groups that are part of this account receive certain benefits, including having the meetup.com dues paid by the [WordPress Community Support, PBC](https://make.wordpress.org/community/2016/03/02/transitioning-to-wordpress-community-support/).

Having a meetup group on this account does require following the Five Good Faith Rules that were created by a group of volunteer meetup organizers.

### The Five Good Faith Rules:

1.  WordPress Meetups are for the benefit of the WordPress community as a whole, not specific businesses or individuals. All actions taken as an event organizer are with the best interest of the community in mind.
2.  Membership in the local meetup group is open to all who wish to join, regardless of ability, skill, financial status or any other criteria.
3.  Meetups are volunteer-run with volunteer speakers.
4.  Meetup groups allow events to be organized by any reliable/trusted member of the community.
5.  Meetups are welcoming places where everyone works to foster an accepting environment which is free of discrimination, incitement to violence, promotion of hate, and general jerk-like behavior.

### Upholding the GPL

We also ask everyone that organizes WordPress Chapter Meetup to uphold the principles of the WordPress open source project, including the GPL. This helps protect the user/attendee, who might not realize that by using a non-GPL plugin or theme, they are giving away the rights that WordPress provides them.

### Facts About the Chapter Meetup Program

*   Meetups are supported by our own WordPress Meetup chapter program, which underwrites the fees for meetup.com, and provides a central support structure for Meetups globally.
*   Joining the Meetup chapter program provides support, information, and help to both new and established meetups.
*   Chapter Meetups provide a consistent experience regardless of where you attend in the world as each group has committed that they will follow a code of conduct and that they agree to our [five good faith rules](https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/meetup-organizer/meetup-program-basics/#the-five-good-faith-rules) for meetups.

## Apply to Organize a Meetup

First, [check whether there is already an active WordPress meetup group in your community](https://www.meetup.com/pro/wordpress/).

**If there is no meetup group in your community** and you would like to start one, fill out the meetup interest form. If you are approved, we will work with you to set up a new group for your city and make you the first organizer.

**If there is an active existing meetup group in your community** (meaning they have had an event in the last three months), please contact the existing organizers to offer your help. Everyone is welcome and encouraged to get involved in WordPress meetups!

**If there is an existing meetup group in your community, but it has been inactive for at least three months**, please complete the interest form. Please be sure to provide the URL for the group, and note that you would like to become a co-organizer to help reactivate the group.

**If you already organize a WordPress group on Meetup.com and want to bring it into the Chapter Program**, please see the [Applying as an Existing Meetup Group page](https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/meetup-organizer/meetup-program-basics/interest-form/).
