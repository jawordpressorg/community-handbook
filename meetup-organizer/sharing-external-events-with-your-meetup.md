# Sharing External Events with Your Meetup

Attendees and organizers can share events that aren’t planned by anyone in the WordPress Chapter Meetup Program with their local meetup group members. These events should be shared with the meetup group using the **Discussions** board or the **email functionality** built into Meetup.com.

Remember, the **Create Event** functionality should only be used to post events planned by your meetup group or another group from the WordPress Chapter Program. 

## Posting Events on the Discussions Board

Meetup.com has a Discussions board built into each site. This is the ideal place to post the details about external events that you think would benefit your community.

### What Information to Post

As with any other event, include the following information:

*   Title
*   Description
*   Location
*   Time duration
*   Event Type (Presentation, Q&A, Hangout, Social, Help Desk, Other)
*   A link or contact for more information
*   Cost

### Why Use the Discussions Board?

Posting on the Discussions board allows the meetup group members to most easily ask questions, see who else is going, and make plans around the event, along with anything else that comes to mind.

These discussions can be a great way to build a stronger community.

## Emailing the Meetup Group About External Events

Organizers can use the email tool in the Manage Group drop down list to share information, like events planned by anyone outside of the WordPress Chapter Meetup Program, with their meetup group.

However, while this option is available, it should be used with caution. Too many emails from a meetup organizer can feel like spam and lead to frustration in the group. Some will even disable their email notifications.

We recommend that you only send an email if you have strong reasons why every member of the meetup should be informed of this event.

**Otherwise, the Discussions board is the best place to post about external events.**
