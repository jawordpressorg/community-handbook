The WordPress \[your-town\] Meetup Group is for any WordPress user – new or experienced – who wants to learn more about WordPress, network with other users and developers, and discuss all things WordPress.

We host \[number\] free meetups a month that address topics aimed at:

• Beginners or people who are not familiar with WordPress

• People using WordPress for their business and websites

• More experienced users who want to do more with WordPress

• Technical-minded developers, designers, and freelancers

Regardless of whether you use WordPress as a developer, designer, business or blogger, our Meetups are sure to help you get the most out of this amazing open source software.

Our Meetups are free to attend. This is all thanks to our incredible sponsors.

We would love for you to be a part of our welcoming, active and enthusiastic group. Please join us and come to the next event!
