# Code of Conduct

This is a template that may inspire the text for your local meetup group page.

Feel free to copy and paste this template and customize it for your area.

Here is the [Community Code of Conduct](https://make.wordpress.org/handbook/community-code-of-conduct/). And here is the [Online Code of Conduct](https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/virtual-events/online-code-of-conduct/) (for online events).

**1\. Purpose**

The WordPress \[YOUR-TOWN\] User Group believes our community should be truly open for everyone. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, ethnicity, religion, age, caste, social class, preferred operating system, programming language, or text editor, among other identifying characteristics.

This code of conduct outlines our expectations for participant behavior as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.

We invite all sponsors, volunteers, speakers, attendees, and other participants to help us realize a safe and positive community experience for everyone.

**2\. Open Source Citizenship**

A supplemental goal of this code of conduct is to increase open source citizenship by encouraging participants to recognize and strengthen the relationships between what we do and the community at large.

In service of this goal, the WordPress \[YOUR-TOWN\] User Group organizers will be taking nominations for exemplary citizens.

If you see someone who is making an extra effort to ensure our community is welcoming, friendly, and encourages all participants to contribute to the fullest extent, we want to know. You can nominate someone by talking to the event organizer or online.

**3\. Expected Behavior**

*   Be considerate, respectful, and collaborative.
*   Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory or harassing behavior and speech.
*   Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants.
*   Alert community organizers if you notice a dangerous situation or someone in distress.
*   Participate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, you help to create WordPress \[YOUR-TOWN\] User Group and make it your own.

**4\. Unacceptable Behavior**

Unacceptable behaviors include: intimidating, harassing, abusive, discriminatory, derogatory or demeaning conduct by any members of  WordPress \[YOUR-TOWN\] User Group and related events. All WordPress \[YOUR-TOWN\] User Group venues may be shared with members of the public; please be respectful to all patrons of these locations.

Harassment includes: offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, disability; inappropriate use of nudity and/or sexual images in public spaces (including presentation slides); deliberate intimidation, stalking or following; harassing photography or recording; sustained disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

**5\. Consequences Of Unacceptable Behavior**

Unacceptable behavior will not be tolerated whether by other attendees, organizers, venue staff, sponsors, or other patrons of the WordPress \[YOUR-TOWN\] User Group venues.

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in unacceptable behavior, the community organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion from the community without warning or refund.

**6\. What To Do If You Witness Or Are Subject To Unacceptable Behavior**

If you are subjected to unacceptable behavior, notice that someone else is being subject to unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify a community organizer as soon as possible or fill out an incident report if the incident was online.

The WordPress \[YOUR-TOWN\] User Group team will be available to help participants contact venue security or local law enforcement, to provide escorts, or to otherwise assist those experiencing unacceptable behavior to feel safe in the community.

**7\. Scope**

We expect all community members, sponsors, volunteers, speakers, attendees, and other guests to abide by this code of conduct at all venues and related social events.
