# Organizing Virtual Meetups

## Technology Resources for Meetup Organizers for Virtual Events

The WordPress chapter meetup program has always emphasized the importance of in-person events over online events, but if there is any evidence of [community transmission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_\(medicine\)#Definition_and_related_terms) of COVID-19 in your area, we encourage organizing online events for the next few months.

This page lists a few resources to hold online meetings in an attempt to prevent or at least delay further COVID-19 infections in local communities. See also [New recommendations for event organizers in light of COVID-19](https://make.wordpress.org/community/2020/03/11/new-recommendations-for-event-organizers-in-light-of-covid-19/) (March 11, 2020) 

Big “Thank you” to Hugh Lashbrooke and other community members for [sharing their thoughts earlier](https://make.wordpress.org/community/2020/03/04/researching-livestream-infrastructure-and-support/). Check out the post for more details. 

## Equipment for hosting a virtual event

*   **Camera**(s): Usually your computer’s built-in camera will work just fine.
*   **Headphones, microphone**: Your computer’s built-in speakers and microphone will suffice, but an external headset will help with clarity.
*   **Meeting/webinar/streaming software**. More on that below!

## Meetup.com Online Events

Meetup.com has made changes to their event interface in light of their recommendations to take meetups online. Under the location box, you can now designate a meetup as an online event and provide a video URL for your attendees to connect with your video.

## Tips and Ideas from WordPress Community Organizers

This section was compiled from the comments of WordPress Community organizers. So much wisdom! 

### Online Meetup Formats

*   **Birds of a Feather** – Breakout rooms for particular topics over lunch
*   **Interactive Educational** – Speaker presents for 20 minutes (chat silent)  / Live Q & A for 20 min (Free Zoom meeting) 
*   **Round Robin** – Topic is voted on ahead of time. Meetup members get in a video call. Moderator guides the meeting, and makes sure everyone is heard who wants to be heard. Three sub topics each discussed for 10 minutes / Rest of the time announcements and news. 
*   **Asynchronous discussion** on web forum (Discourse, bbPress, etc. ) 
*   **HelpDesk Hours online** – A group of volunteers are available for meetup members to help with their website 

### Tips for Larger Events

*   A website or page with communication zones, e.g. workshop rooms, speaker rooms, watercooler, etc.
*   Each room should be easy to join/leave whenever an attendee likes.
*   Event-specific rooms should be moderated, e.g. participants have to be muted during the presentations, voice/chat communication should happen at the end, some way to “raise a hand” to ask a question can be implemented in the chat.
*   The speaker/presenter should not be distracted by chat/questions during a talk, so a moderator (or moderators) should handle participants muting, helping with tech issues, tackling the chat communications, and managing Q&A discussions.
*   ‘Info desk’ and ‘Tech support’ could be implemented in the chat.
*   There could be an option to start “breakout rooms” via ad-hoc calls for 1-on-1 or mini-group communications.
*   Speakers could have personal video rooms where people can chat after the session.
*   Events in Virtual Reality could be fun and interesting, like [this example of a Hallway Track in VR](https://carb.is/2020/03/virtual-hallway-track/).

### Live Audience Engagement / Keeping Attention 

*   Surveys/polls during talks (speakers usually ask questions to direct talks in certain directions).
*   Q & A process (perhaps votable so more popular questions rises to the top). [Slido](https://www.sli.do/) is one example of this.
*   Share slides and materials right after (or before) in a central location. 
*   Chat window next to the lives tream or within the livestream tool (YouTube Live, Zoom etc) 
*   Alternative way to collect Question is via Twitter and event Hashtag 
*   All participants attend via Video and Audio (ie: Brady Bunch view in Zoom). Only for smaller groups. (Meetup or Unconference format)
*   Especially encouraging Q&A to be on camera rather than through the chat.

**Comments to take to heart:**

*   “As someone who attends a livestream event every week, I was surprised at how hard it is to manage the concurrent chat as the organizer.”
*   “Even with my experience of having just one talk from one person, I would like to add for consideration: Have someone else monitoring the chat. It’s too much to read it and deliver content at the same time.
*   “Any kind of chat-type interface used alongside the livestream, would need to be some kind of moderator training.”

The **Community Managers Hub (CMXHub)** published a long post with resources and tips: [A Comprehensive List of Tips, Tools, and Examples for Event Organizers During the Coronavirus Outbreak](https://cmxhub.com/a-comprehensive-list-of-tips-tools-and-examples-for-event-organizers-during-the-coronavirus-outbreak/) (3/9/2020)

## Music and Copyright Considerations

To comply with global copyright laws, when organizing a WordPress event, please only use royalty-free, public domain, or Creative Commons-licensed music in the live event space, in recorded video, and in live streams. [You can find public domain and CCO music on Openverse.](https://openverse.org/search/audio?q=music&license=pdm,cc0)

#### **✅ Music Compliance Checklist**

Before your event, confirm the following:

*   **Will music be played in the event space, live streams, or recordings?**  
    If yes, confirm that it is royalty-free, public domain, or Creative Commons-licensed music.
*   **Are vendors or production teams using music?**  
    If yes, verify that it is royalty-free, public domain, or Creative Commons-licensed music.
*   **Have you reviewed applicable copyright guidelines?**  
    Copyright laws can vary by location. For further guidance, visit the [World Intellectual Property Organization’s (WIPO) music copyright resource](https://href.li/?https://www.wipo.int/en/web/music).

By following these steps, you can prevent disruptions to your live streams, maintain control over event content, and ensure compliance with copyright laws. Please note that this is not legal advice, and i
