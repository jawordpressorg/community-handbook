# 2022: Returning to In-person WordPress Meetups

In 2020, [WordCamps moved online in response to the COVID-19 pandemic](https://make.wordpress.org/community/2020/03/11/new-recommendations-for-event-organizers-in-light-of-covid-19/). After many discussions, the Global Community Team made a decision to help WordPress meetup organizers [return to hosting in-person meetups with caution](https://make.wordpress.org/community/2021/07/01/in-person-meetup-events-for-vaccinated-community-members/), in communities that have effectively contained COVID-19 or have vaccines and testing freely available, as in July 2021. Consequently, in September 2021, the team [announced the return of in-person WordCamps following updated guidelines](https://make.wordpress.org/community/2021/09/13/announcement-updated-guidelines-for-in-person-wordcamps/). Following the arrival of new COVID variants and a spike in COVID-19 cases around the world, the team [published a set of revised guidelines](https://make.wordpress.org/community/2022/01/24/updated-guidelines-for-in-person-wordcamps-and-meetups-2022) for in-person WordPress events in January 2022.

Finally, as mandates related to COVID-19 are continuing to update around the world, and the Community Team’s COVID-19 requirements are updating with them. **Last update: April 21, 2022.**

This handbook page explains the steps involved in organizing an in-person WordCamp [as per the latest guidelines in 2022](https://make.wordpress.org/community/2022/04/21/announcement-updated-covid-19-guidelines-for-official-wordpress-events/).

The WordPress community team is not expecting nor requiring local organizers to organize in-person events, even for fully vaccinated people — we’re simply removing the barrier to doing so. Organizers can continue planning online events for their community – even if it is safe in their regions to organize in-person events or if local laws allow meetups. 

### Guidelines for In-Person WordCamps organizers

Here are the guidelines for organizing in-person WordCamps:

*   Follow all local regulations. These continue to change, so please ensure you have the latest information, especially as you get closer to the event. Further, if your local hospitals are overwhelmed, please cancel, postpone, or move the event online.
*   Provide masks and hand sanitizer around the venue space (WPCS will cover this cost if it is not provided by your venue).
*   As part of swag packs, WPCS will provide a sticker to indicate to others to please wear a mask when talking with you.

If legally permissible in the area, organizers can certainly opt to have more security measures for their event, like mandatory masks and checks for proof of vaccine or negative tests at the door. Of course, organizing events online will continue to be an option.

### **Recommendations for attendees**

These are strong recommendations for attendees. Organizers can help by confirming that these recommendations comply with local rules and regulations.

*   We still recommend that you wear a mask while at in-person WordPress events.
*   If you see that someone is wearing a sticker requesting people wear a mask near them, please wear a mask while within 6 feet (2 meters) of them or keep your distance.
*   A request that you only attend in-person if you are vaccinated or have recently tested negative.
*   Please stay at home if you are sick or have recently come in contact with someone who is ill.

These reminders will be added to WordCamp ticket purchase pages.
