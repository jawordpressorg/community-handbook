# Helpful templates for meetup organizers

Meetup organizers may find these templates helpful in communicating with attendees as they begin to return to in-person events. In the case that it is not safe to meet in-person, we have also provided some language to help meetup organizers explain this to members.

*Note: To better support our global community, having translations of these templates would be incredibly helpful! Please send us your translations to [support@wordcamp.org](mailto:support@wordcamp.org) and weâ€™ll add it to this page after the validation of the corresponding Polyglots team.*

### Returning to in-person meetups

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the WordPress Community Team asked all official WordPress events to be held online. The [Community Team is now helping meetup groups determine whether or not they can move forward with an in-person event](https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/meetup-organizer/2021-returning-to-in-person-meetups/), based on a number of safety and security questions. Our community has passed [this checklist](https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/meetup-organizer/2021-returning-to-in-person-meetups/in-person-meetup-decision-checklist/), so at this time, we are moving forward with an in person meetup!

Because situations involving COVID-19 can change quickly, we will be checking our local situation against the Community Team provided checklist the day before our meetup. If we need to cancel or change our in-person meetup to be online, we will let you know as soon as possible.

### Expected behavior and safety protocols

We know that everyone has waited to see their WordPress friends again in-person. To do it safely, **we expect that you do not attend if you are feeling sick**. Also, keep all guidelines from local authorities in mind, and if suggested, wear a mask and keep distance between you and others.

As a precaution, we will require all attendees to register their in-person attendance on arrival to facilitate contact-tracing in the unfortunate event that something goes wrong.

To ensure the safety of you and others, following the protocols organisers put in place is important. Itâ€™s nice to see each other again in person, but letâ€™s do it as safely as possible! In case something happens, you can always contact us or the WordPress Community Team Deputies.

### Gathering information for contact tracing

We do require everyone to sign in on the contact tracing registerÂ  as a precaution, in case it comes to our knowledge that one or more meetup attendees may have been exposed to COVID-19. Even though some community members may be using automatic contact tracing apps, maintaining a contact tracing register is important as we canâ€™t ensure that everyone is using the app. Our contact tracing procedure will follow best practices as required by our local government and the WordPress Community Team.

We will be collecting your name, city, and phone number. All information will be destroyed about a month after the meetup event and will not be used for any other purpose than reaching out to you in the instance that there has been exposure to COVID-19. If you have any more questions, we are happy to answer! ðŸ™‚

### Why are we not meeting in person yet?

You may have seen that the WordPress Community Team created [a checklist to determine whether or not meetups can proceed with an in-person event based on a number of safety and security questions](https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/meetup-organizer/2021-returning-to-in-person-meetups/in-person-meetup-decision-checklist/). We have completed the checklist and learned that at this time, our community does not meet the Community Teamâ€™s threshold for safely holding an in-person meetup. We will keep checking our local situation against the checklist so that we can meet in-person as soon as possible! For now, we look forward to seeing you online at our next event.

# For organizers: about gathering information for contact tracing

We expect organizers to gather contact details from attendees for possible contact tracing in the event that COVID-19 exposure occurs. Even if your country has an app for automatic contact tracing, providing an alternative method of gathering the information is important as it is possible that not all attendees are using the app, they may have drained battery, or the automatic tracing may not be working for some other reason.

By maintaining a list of contact details we can ensure that if you or our Community Team Deputies ([use this contact form](https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/meetup-organizer/2021-returning-to-in-person-meetups/in-person-meetup-report-form/)) are made aware of possible exposure to COVID-19 during the meetup, we can reach out to everyone easily. If you become aware of possible COVID-19 exposure in your meetup, please contact Community Team Deputies without delay and cooperate with your local authorities as required to facilitate contact tracing.

Check the local guidelines on what information should be gathered (and how) in case your local authorities do require keeping a record of attendees in a specific method or format. The Community Team suggests at minimum: name, city, email address, and optional phone number.

Be sure to follow [Data Handling Best Practices](https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/wordcamp-organizer/first-steps/web-presence/data-handling-best-practices/) and make sure that the list isnâ€™t accessible to others aside from you and/or your co-organisers. Destroy the list one month after the event. It is prohibited to use the list for any other purpose than in situations where attendees might have been exposed to COVID-19 and should not be shared with anyone other than Community Team Deputies or local health authorities. Possible misuse of the list is a [Code of Conduct](https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/meetup-organizer/resources/code-of-conduct/) violation.
