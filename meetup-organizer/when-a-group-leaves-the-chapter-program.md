# When a Group Leaves the Chapter Program

Sometimes a group will leave the chapter program. Reasons include:

1.  The lead organizer needs to step down and cannot find a replacement.
2.  The group hasn’t had an event in 6 or more months, and the organizer doesn’t have plans to organize another event.
3.  A group decides they no longer want to be part of the chapter.

In the first two cases, the Community Team makes an effort to find new organizers for the group, and if that effort doesn’t result in a new organizer volunteering, the group will be removed from the chapter program.

When a Meetup group is removed from the WordPress chapter account, WordPress steps down as the organizer. WordPress will no longer pay the dues for the account since WP is no longer the owner of the group.

Since there will also not be any other organizers, no one else will be charged dues until another member becomes the organizer. If a group becomes active again, and and the new or now-active organizers would like to re-join the chapter, they should complete the [Meetup Interest Form](https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/meetup-organizer/getting-started/interest-form/).
