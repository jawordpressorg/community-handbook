# Leaving the Chapter Program

If your group is struggling, needs help, or is ready to leave the chapter program, email [support@wordcamp.org](mailto:support@wordcamp.org).

Sometimes a group will leave the chapter program. Reasons can include:

*   The lead organizer needs to step down and cannot find a replacement.
*   The group hasn’t had an event in 6 or more months, and the organizer doesn’t have plans to organize another event.
*   A group decides they no longer want to be part of the WordPress Meetup Chapter Program.

When the meetup needs a new organizer, the Community Team attempts to find one within the group. However, the group will be removed from the chapter program if a new organizer can’t be found.

## Steps to Removing a Group from the Chapter

1.  A member of the Community Team will email the group that it will be closed in two weeks and direct them to other WordPress Chapter Meetups if any are available.
2.  The meetup group is marked as “**Retired**” in the Meetup.com directory. 
3.  A member of the Community Team will email our point of contact at meetup.com to receive all data related to the closed group. Once we remove a group, we lose access to their data in the meetup.com report tool.

## Dues Once a Group is Removed

WordPress no longer pays the dues for the account since WordPress is no longer the owner of the group. Since there are no other organizers, no one will be charged dues until another member becomes the organizer. 

## When the group decided to withdraw from the WordPress Meetup Chapter Program

1.  Send an email to [support@wordcamp.org](mailto:support@wordcamp.org) expressing your wish to leave the chapter group.
2.  The program supporter will confirm that the decision to leave is the will of all the co-organizers.
3.  Once the will of all the co-organizers has been confirmed, the program supporter will contact [Meetup.com](http://meetup.com/) and ask them to transfer the organizer account to the representative member of the co-organizers.

## Re-joining the WordPress Chapter Meetup Program

If a group becomes active again, and the new or now-active organizers would like to re-join the chapter, they should complete the [Meetup Interest Form](https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/meetup-organizer/getting-started/interest-form/).
