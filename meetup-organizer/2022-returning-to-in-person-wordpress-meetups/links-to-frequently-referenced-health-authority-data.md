# Links to frequently referenced health authority data

### Finding local statistics

The first place to search for local statistics is your local health authority, if you have one. Start by doing a simple web search for your area (state, province, district etc.) and country along with the search term `COVID-19`. Look for URLs that provide reputable and reliable information. Examples of these include:

*   [https://covid.cdc.gov](https://covid.cdc.gov)
*   [https://www.health.gov.au/](https://www.health.gov.au/)
*   [https://doh.gov.ph/](https://doh.gov.ph/)

If your local region does not have an equivalent health authority OR that authority is not currently publishing the required data, you can broaden your sources by also considering global health organizations or educational institutions.

The Community Team has compiled the following list of public health authorities and examples of local resources that organizers can look to for data such as positivity rates, number of cases, etc. If no currently listed health authority applies to your community, please feel free to use another reputable resource that does, and let us know and we will add it to this list.

### Calculating the statistics

**Positive Rate in the last 28 days (percentage)**

**\[**Total positive cases in the past 28 days / Total tests completed in the past 28 days\] x 100

Example:

If there have been six reported cases and 100,000 tests completed, the rate would be  
\[6 / 100,000\] x 100 = 0.006%

**Cases per 100,000 people in the last 14 days**

\[100,000 x Number of new cases in the past 14 days\] / Population

Example:

If there have been 250 cases new cases reported in the past 14 days and the population of the area for which they were reported is 5 million, the calculation would be

\[100,000 x 250\] / 5,000,000 = 5 cases per 100,000 people
