Your WordPress meetup event can be anything you like. Who are the people you have talked to about setting up your meetup interested in? Start there.

If you are looking for inspiration about the kinds of meetups that people host, [here are some ideas](https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/meetup-organizer/event-formats/).

Where should we hold our meetup? [#Where should we hold our meetup?](#where-should-we-hold-our-meetup)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Where you hold your meetup will depend on the kind of meetup you have. If it’s a casual hangout, then coffee shops and public spaces are a great idea. If you are keen on doing some educational or informational meetups, you may want to look at your city or town’s public education locations.

Your meetup group members and their network of contacts can be a great resource for meetup venues; ask group members to suggest venue ideas for future gatherings if one of your favorite spots suddenly becomes unavailable or if you’re struggling to find somewhere to meet.

Here are some locations that other WordPress meetup/user groups have found work for them:

*   public library
*   coffee shop
*   community college
*   state university
*   co-office/co-working space
*   community center
*   the conference room of a friendly local business
*   restaurant
*   food court at a mall

To ensure that meetups are as inclusive as possible, we now ask organizers to avoid holding events at venues that have ties to religious or political organizations. Our goal is for any event to be welcoming for every member of the WordPress community (regardless of economic or social status, race, color, ethnic origin, national origin, creed, religion, political belief, gender, sexual orientation, marital status, age, or disability), and thus we avoid venues with affiliations that might not be inclusive.

How do I post my meetup on meetup.com? [#How do I post my meetup on meetup.com?](#how-do-i-post-my-meetup-on-meetup-com)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the center column of your group’s meetup.com home page just below the title of your group you will see a plus sign (+) and the text “Suggest a new meetup”. Select that and complete the following information.

Because meetup.com will update your members as you make adjustments to the page, in order to help the group retain a non-“spammy” feel, we ask that you have the following items ready to go when you post your suggestion.

1.  Title
2.  Description
3.  Location
4.  Time duration
5.  Event Type (Presentation, Q&A, Hangout, Social, Help Desk, Other)

Here are some suggestions for event title formats that start with a targeted user level or event type to help your members quickly decide if the event is for them:

*   Beginner: Managing images in WordPress
*   Intermediate: How to troubleshoot a plugin
*   Social: Bloggers meet and greet
*   Developer Beginner: Building your first plugin
*   Developer: Breakfast with Q&A
*   All Levels: WordPress Help Desk
*   Hangout: Let’s chat about our sites over coffee

Event organizers for meetups should [follow the same rules as WordCamp](https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/wordcamp-organizer-handbook/planning-details/speakers/) when finding eligible speakers. We do ask that individuals do not schedule meetups in order to sell products or services.

Teaching a workshop organized by an official meetup group is a contribution to the WordPress open source project, just like submitting a patch to core, writing documentation for the codex, or answering questions in the support forums.

Can I get sponsors for our meetup? [#Can I get sponsors for our meetup?](#can-i-get-sponsors-for-our-meetup)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Please read the [following post before you continue](https://make.wordpress.org/community/2014/05/07/meetup-sponsorships-and-other-local-community-stuff/).

There are no specific rules around sponsorship, other than [the set of expectations for participation with official WordPress events](https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/wordcamp-organizer-handbook/become-an-organizer/representing-wordpress/) (External link to WordCamp handbook). However, we want local communities to focus on sharing knowledge and connecting with each other, not on providing a cheap marketing platform.

Handling money for a community event can get complicated quickly (taxes! transparency!), so we suggest that any and all sponsorship be approached as “in-kind” — for example, when a company sponsors by ordering pizzas or a sandwich platter for a certain event. Meetup group organizers should not use the group as a sponsorship/marketing platform, according to the [five good-faith rules](https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/meetup-organizer/meetup-program-basics/#the-five-good-faith-rules).

There are many ways to help attract members to your event. Please keep in mind that it may take one or two tries to gain traction while others may be a smash hit from the start. Some suggestions for the event itself:

*   Find a time when people can attend.
*   Choose a location that is easy to find and has easy or free parking.
*   If you select a topic choose one that you are interested in or knowledgeable about.
*   Optimize your meetup.com page/s and welcome email to give people great information about your meetup There are [more ideas on how to do that](https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/meetup-organizer/getting-started/optimizing-your-meetup-page/), and \[[resources to help you do that on this page here](https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/meetup-organizer/resources/)\]

How do I spread the word about our meetup?: [#How do I spread the word about our meetup?:](#how-do-i-spread-the-word-about-our-meetup)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*   Meetup.com: Any scheduled events will be shared with the meetup group via email. Please keep in mind users have the option to turn this feature of meetup off and may not receive your meetup emails.
*   Meetup.com: group message board
*   Other Groups: contacting local PHP, Javascript, social media, blogging, or open source groups (etc) to tell them about a new WordPress group in town
*   Websites: city blogs, local tech community message boards or event listings
*   Twitter: connect with local users who have an interest in WordPress and community
*   Flyers: if there’s a local coffee shop where you see other people blogging or coding, put up a flyer there. Same thing with your local co-working space.
